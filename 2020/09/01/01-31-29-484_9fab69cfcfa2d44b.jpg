Or, more specifically, to buy parts of TikTok for $20 billion. \nThose parts include TikTok's U.S., Australian, New Zealand, and Indian components — locations where the ByteDance-owned company ran into various legal troubles, faced security concerns, and risks possible shuttering. India went so far as to ban TikTok outright in June for \"[engaging] in activities which is prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, security of state and public order.\" \nTriller, perhaps smelling blood in the water, joins the ever-growing list of U.S. companies trying to get a piece of TikTok's huge social media market share. As of the time of this writing, Microsoft, Twitter, Oracle, and Walmart have all reportedly expressed interest in buying TikTok's U.S. assets. \nIn August, TikTok revealed that it has approximately 100 million monthly active users in the U.S.\nWe reached out to TikTok, Triller, and the asset management fund in question, Centricus, both in an effort to confirm Bloomberg's reporting and to learn if TikTok had responded to an offer. Neither Triller nor Centricus responded, and a TikTok spokesperson merely pointed us to previous news coverage. \nA Centricus spokesperson reportedly confirmed to Bloomberg that the company had made an offer. A Reuters report from Friday claims TikTok denies knowledge of any offer. \nBloomberg was able to wrangle a more interesting comment from a TikTok spokesperson, however, who suggested the entire thing wasn't even worth the company's time. \nSEE ALSO: TikTok wants to 'eliminate hate' on its platform. Good luck with that.\n\"What's Triller?\" the spokesperson reportedly replied. \nSuch a response suggests that if Triller does end up buying TikTok's U.S. assets, it won't be because TikTok viewed the deal as a match made in digital heaven."},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118713%252F1f8c1363-ebb9-499d-a7ee-1e606fd02485.png%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.png?signature=ke80B0Ci4i9IV92HbMU8QZi35RE=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118713%252F1f8c1363-ebb9-499d-a7ee-1e606fd02485.png%252F1438x0.png?signature=-2_IEAU4q4LUYO4WkJZa1VcysGM=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118713%252F1f8c1363-ebb9-499d-a7ee-1e606fd02485.png%252F800x360.png?signature=4EVUs9k2EIxXu5yMuTClFyRv4gI=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"800x360#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118713%252F1f8c1363-ebb9-499d-a7ee-1e606fd02485.png%252F1600x720.png?signature=AGt6DtnRzhjS9CspNNesKpTSJ14=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"1600x720#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"And now Triller is trying to buy U.S. TikTok, report claims","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118713%252F1f8c1363-ebb9-499d-a7ee-1e606fd02485.png%252F800x360.png?signature=4EVUs9k2EIxXu5yMuTClFyRv4gI=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"png","loading":"lazy","version_webp_srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118713%252F1f8c1363-ebb9-499d-a7ee-1e606fd02485.webp%252F800x360.webp?signature=YVBmYkY_5nqat-XSriEb1_DZ7BU=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 800w","naturalWidth":"800","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118713%252F1f8c1363-ebb9-499d-a7ee-1e606fd02485.png%252F800x360.png?signature=4EVUs9k2EIxXu5yMuTClFyRv4gI=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 800w","sizes":"800w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":{}},"display_title":"And now Triller is trying to buy U.S. TikTok, report claims","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"Triller joins an ever-growing list of companies trying to get a piece of that TikTok pie.

The term is used to describe the act of scrolling through social media feeds and consuming a seemingly endless amount of concerning news. If you're anything like me, you enjoy being in the know at all times, and news-related FOMO makes you reluctant to unplug from social media. So doomscrolling can be a hard habit to break.\nWanting to stay informed is totally understandable, but there are ways to do so that don't take as large of a toll on your mental health as doomscrolling does. In an effort to help our fellow doomscrollers cut back on the potentially harmful habit, we've compiled a comprehensive list of practical steps you can take to stop doomscrolling. We hope these suggestions help, and remember: It's OK to be offline every now and again.\n1. Reorganize the apps on your phone\nIf you're looking to start small, reorganizing the apps on your device is a simple way to put a little bit of distance between you and your social media feeds.\nRather than keeping popular apps like Twitter and Instagram (or anything you don't want to use as often) on your homepage, move them to the third or fourth page of your device so you have to do some work to access them. I personally keep my Twitter app on the last page of my iPhone in a folder labeled \"Don't Touch,\" and though I still use it often, the setup does makes me think twice before clicking and occasionally persuades me to reevaluate.\n\nAn editor of mine also suggested periodically deleting social media apps from your phone. Doing so will hopefully help you check the platforms less frequently, since you'll only be accessing them on desktop.\n2. Set usage limits and be aware of your screen time\nIf you're not in the mood to reorganize your apps (or have done so and are now looking to take some extra steps) consider setting time limits for the usage of certain apps.\nIf there's a specific app you're looking to cut back on, see if there's a way to add usage restrictions within the platform. For instance, Instagram lets you manage your activity. All you have to do is go to your profile on the app and click the three lines in the upper right hand corner of your screen. After doing so, select \"Your Activity\" and \"Set Daily Reminder.\" You can choose an amount of time between five minutes and 23 hours and 55 minutes (lmao.) Then, after you've used up your daily Instagram minutes the app will alert you so you can cut back on usage.\n\nIf you have an iPhone, iPad, or Mac, you can also use Screen Time. The feature allows you to monitor how often you use your screen, see which apps you spend the most time on, and set daily time limits for them. You can also use Screen Time's \"Downtime\" feature to set scheduled time away from your screen. \"During downtime, only apps that you choose to allow and phone calls will be available,\" the setting reads.\nGoogle's Digital Wellbeing was also created to help people manage their tech usage and find a healthy balance between online and offline life. You can learn more information about your tech habits, along with tips on how to focus and tools to help you unplug on wellbeing.google. And if you need to stop scrolling social media on your phone and desktop, the website blocker, Freedom, can help, too. You can test out the service with a free trial, and there are also several free browser extensions available for download. (Compatible with Mac, Windows, iOD, Android, Chromebook, and Linux.)\n\nIf you're not into app-specific time limits, consider setting a daily alarm to remind yourself to unplug. For instance, if a \"Stop Doomscrolling\" alarm goes off at 9:00 p.m. and tells you to unplug, you might remember to enjoy the rest of your night social media free. Doesn't that sound lovely?\n3. Switch to a Good Screen (or abandon screens all together)\nAfter a long day of being online, I consider any screen that displays social media to be Bad. Good screens include televisions, e-book readers, and gaming consoles — but laptops and phones have the ability to be good depending on their purpose.\nInstead of wasting hours doomscrolling, use your devices for something fun! Catch up on some television shows, shop, play a video game, and read or write for pleasure. \nAnother great way to ensure you don't spiral into another doomscrolling session is to do something that doesn't involve a screen at all. Read a physical book. Take a walk. Safely catch up with friends and family members. Try paint-by-numbers. Practice some self-care. Finding hobbies and activities that bring you joy and separate you from social media is important. \n4. Physically distance yourself from your screens\nIf you're still struggling to restrict your social media usage, consider taking slightly more drastic measures.\nFor starters, try turning the volume on and leaving your phone in a different room whenever you feel you need a break. You won't check it as frequently, but you'll still be able to hear any incoming messages or calls.\nYou can also consider buying a phone case with a cover on it, like these, in hopes of making less eye contact with your screen. And I highly recommend downloading a productivity app, such as Forest, which locks your screen for a set amount of time. The app discourages you from checking your phone by planting a cute virtual tree that will only grow to completion if your phone remains locked for the set time. The app holding you accountable is definitely encouraging.\n\nIf you haven't already, you should also make an effort to sleep apart from your phone and other tech devices. Earlier this year, I tried sleeping in a separate room as my phone for a week and though the separation admittedly took some getting used to, falling asleep and waking up without social media at my fingertips was truly refreshing.\nIf you rely on your phone to wake you up every morning, it's time to take the plunge and splurge on a real alarm clock. If you love tech but are trying to cut screens out of your room entirely, the Loftie Clock is the perfect alarm for you. It's a bit pricey (you can pre-order one for $129) but the clock offers a bunch of phone-related perks without all the distractions of social media.\n\n5. Switch up the ways in which you consume news\nFollowing trusted sources and having the ability to see trending topics in the area of your choosing makes it possible to get the majority of your news from social media. In some ways, that's convenient. But the constant consumption of news, updates, and opinions also makes logging off difficult.\nIn an attempt to start using social media less, try using other news sources more. Instead of spending hours on your timeline, try visiting platforms like Apple News and Flipboard to get straight news without all the other distractions of social media. You can also sign up for informative newsletters and set aside time in your day to watch the news and catch up on what you missed. (Just remember to turn it off after an hour or two and unwind for the rest of the night.)\nIf you're searching for more instant information gratification, sign up for some breaking news alerts or enable social media notifications for select users. This way, you can stay in-the-know without having to scroll all the time.\nWe're in the middle of a global pandemic and only months away from the U.S. presidential election, so every social media scroll is bound to feature some level of doom. But if you make an honest effort to cut back on doomscrolling, you'll definitely have more time in your day to experience moments of genuine joy."},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1447409%252Fe91c3a43-3aae-4234-abe8-5988b3fe93d1.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=2EgN7CVZUf4uU0yqYdWYkBi9zco=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F117966%252F4f5a02ba-6957-41f2-ba0e-2693f88bacf5.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=0LtTvNOfcTOBrIleD4uDYYvVACk=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F117966%252F4f5a02ba-6957-41f2-ba0e-2693f88bacf5.jpg%252F280x158.jpg?signature=4zkxNMqM-XL9BrZMp8acgnf7OTk=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"280x158#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F117966%252F4f5a02ba-6957-41f2-ba0e-2693f88bacf5.jpg%252F560x316.jpg?signature=ZA0Gw82DBS7V7udWGnD_khr3TD0=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x316#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"5 practical ways to cut back on doomscrolling","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F117966%252F4f5a02ba-6957-41f2-ba0e-2693f88bacf5.jpg%252F280x158.jpg?signature=4zkxNMqM-XL9BrZMp8acgnf7OTk=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"jpg","loading":"lazy","version_webp_srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F117966%252F4f5a02ba-6957-41f2-ba0e-2693f88bacf5.webp%252F280x158.webp?signature=-1qBjwhMYeV36P2-_sMb40ZLHIY=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w","naturalWidth":"280","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F117966%252F4f5a02ba-6957-41f2-ba0e-2693f88bacf5.jpg%252F280x158.jpg?signature=4zkxNMqM-XL9BrZMp8acgnf7OTk=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w","sizes":"280w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":{}},"display_title":"5 practical ways to cut back on doomscrolling","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"gElYVYG8oQ","data-source":"blueprint"}],"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"We've all had enough doom.

A number of porn performers and producers promptly went into panic mode, decrying or lamenting this impending death blow.\nThese concerns, it appears, were overblown. We're more than halfway through this year, and there are no signs of a major shift, much less a crackdown. In fact, Twitter tells Mashable that it has not changed, nor does it plan to change, its policies on sensitive media (its euphemism for violent and adult content), or the way it enforces those policies. \nThis wasn't the first time a major wave of Twitter-related paranoia has swept the industry. Similar reports about an oncoming all-out war on porn made the rounds in 2015 and 2017, and notably never amount to much either. \nBut the level of concern this coverage stoked just demonstrates how vital Twitter has become — and how devastating its loss would be — to the health and stability of the adult industry. \nAnd even if a crackdown is not on its way in the short term — a near certainty especially in our current state of pandemic-induced suspended animation — many social media and adult industry experts still believe those working in the porn have good reason to fear an eventual Twitter porn-pocalypse.  \nPorn's social media revolution\nAbout a decade ago, tube sites offering free porn took off, and the bottom fell out of the old school porn industry. Around the same time, the democratization of online video production, shifts in the way many people think about sex and sexuality, and a host of other factors led to a spike in the number of people making amateur or indie studio porn — or even dipping their toes into mainstream porn production. \nFacing increasing competition for a decreasing pool of paying customers, many porn performers and producers gradually realized that they needed to build strong brands and deep connections with loyal fanbases — to be more connected and personified — to survive or thrive. So naturally, they turned to social media, a tool custom built for that sort of outreach and marketing. \nFor years now, performers and producers have used mainstream social media to send out a constant stream of humanizing slice-of-life photos and videos. These platforms have also allowed them to interact directly (and often pithily and effectively) with their fans. As (usually non-sexual) porn performer and publicist James Bartholet notes, studios (some of whom have started shooting scenes again after months of pandemic-related production holds) now look at performers’ follower counts to figure out who has a large fan base they can market to (or piggyback off of), and thus who to hire. The bulk of these studios’ advertising to those fan bases whenever they release new titles plays out on social media, as well. Ditto for strip clubs (some of which have also reopened), which shell out higher rates for feature dances from performers they believe will draw a crowd. \nPerformers also directly monetize their social media followings. Some create private or locked accounts then sell access to fans who crave a sense of intimacy and connection with these idealized icons. Most drive loyal fans from their public social media accounts to their personal sites, or to platforms like Clips4Sale, ManyVids, and the increasingly popular and visible OnlyFans, where they sell often custom-made clips or subscriptions that give fans access to a constant flow of usually self-created and well protected content with a lot of personality baked into it. \nMany performers and producers get close to 100 percent of their traffic from social media referrals. As such, social media has been essential, notes Heather Berg, who studies modern porn work, to the rise of profitable independent porn stars. Most of them work safely and on their own terms “without paying high fees to managers and third-party processors.” (These types of stars are also the ones who've best weathered the restrictions and upheavals of the pandemic.) \nSurviving by the grace of social media has its risks, however. A number of performers have told me in recent years that porn used to be like a nine-to-five job; they could turn off their onscreen personas, industry drama, and fan chatter and critiques when they went off the clock. Now, they say, they often feel like they have to be on — and exposed to brutal vitriol of trolls and entitlement of keyboard warrior fans — all the time. As it is for other influencers, this constant pressure and feedback can be grueling \nBut, argues Mike Stabile of the Free Speech Coalition, an industry group originally founded 29 years ago to fight obscenity and censorship laws, social media has also made the industry safer. \n“Adult performers use it to call out bad producers, to warn people about… exploitation” with a freedom, reach, and volume amplification they never could before, he says. “For the FSC, we use it to get out information about production holds” after one or more performers test positive for an STI, “report bad actors or policy changes, put out alerts about fraud attempts,” and much more. It is especially useful, he says, for reaching performers who don’t live in Los Angeles, porn’s old (and increasingly irrelevant) physical capital, or work in traditional studios and so would be hard to contact through conventional means. \nLeya Tanit, a performer and founder of Pineapple Support, which offers mental health education and does outreach to set adult stars up with services, explains that their team uses social media to keep an eye out for, and offer support to, marginalized or isolated performers who seem to be struggling. \nSocial media platforms have also made it easier for porn industry figures to organize politically and share their stories with the mainstream press and broader public, Stabile adds. “I don’t think the awareness around … sex worker rights would be where it is” without social media, he says. \nThe problem with platforms\nFor about five years, Twitter has been by far the most important social media platform for the porn world, if only because it has been the least hostile to it — and to discussions and depictions of sex and sexuality in general. Facebook and Instagram have squeezed nudity, and many forms of sexual conversation, off of their platforms to the point that last fall the former started censoring eggplant and peach emojis in certain types of user posts and conversations. \nTumblr, once a haven for erotic talk and imagery, especially for minority sexual communities, fully banned adult content in December 2018. And performers allege that Snapchat, despite its origins as a thoroughly sext-focused app, has periodically targeted their accounts for censorship, or just fully purged them, for years. \nMost of these platforms make allowances for moderate sexual dialogue, especially in educational, artistic, or documentary materials. But everyone from non-pornographic artists and models to pole dancers to sexual educators (especially in the queer community) claim that most platforms are overzealous at best in their enforcement, often censoring even what should be allowed, and is by almost any reasonable standard innocuous, sexual (if perhaps vaguely sexualizable) content. \nPorn stars especially argue that these platforms frequently target them with over-harsh enforcement, and often outright bans, even when they play by the rules. Notably, last fall a performer’s group documented over 1,000 instances in which Instagram allegedly deleted adult stars’ accounts even when they complied with community guidelines restricting the display or discussion of sex or nudity.\n“Every year, we are seeing more and more discrimination towards sex workers on all of the major social media platforms,” argues Tony Rios, president of the porn trade media house AVN.\nExcept for Twitter, that is. They have long banned nudity and simulated or unstimulated sex acts in profile photos and header images. They require posters to mark any tweets containing adult content, or accounts that frequently feature such material, as sensitive. And they have banned the delivery of unsolicited messages containing sensitive content to others. These are all fairly reasonable efforts to keep people who don’t want to see adult content on Twitter from chancing upon it incidentally. \nBut despite banning adult content on Vine (which they owned) in 2014, they’ve refrained from enacting restrictions anywhere near as stringent as the other social media giants. In fact Twitter has been so friendly to porn performers and producers by comparison that anti-porn groups like Fight The New Drug and the National Center on Sexual Exploitation treat it as one of the greatest abettors of what they see as a leading global health and safety menace.  \nThe fact that Twitter has held out for so long as a porn-friendly space while the rest of the social media world has turned away from sex and sexuality leaves porn stars waiting for what many feel is an inevitable cave in and crackdown, explains adult star Cherie DeVille. Hence the mild-to-major industry panic and suspicion anytime Twitter makes literally any move even vaguely related to sexual content or discourse, whether that’s adjusting its policies or going after spam bots. \nReading between the lines of the terms of service\nThe recent panic seemingly started when Twitter announced that it would amend its policies at the start of 2020 to comply with new privacy laws in California and the European Union. This led a number of users to dive into the platform’s terms of service (TOS), where they noticed what seemed like new restrictions on sensitive media. Commentators focused especially on the fact that Twitter’s TOS list depictions of “bodily fluids, including blood, feces, [and] semen” within their definition depictions of graphic violence, explicitly forbid any depiction of simulated or actual sexual or sexualized violence in any context, and feature a line about a policy on censoring accounts dedicated to sharing sensitive media. Twitter had actually seemingly slipped this language into its TOS months earlier in an attempt to add clarity to old rules, not to substantively alter them. \nAnti-censorship activists have been concerned about vague social media TOS since platforms like Twitter launched, notes Nora Pelazzari of the National Coalition Against Censorship, arguing that they can and do use ambiguity as a blank check to restrict all manner of speech that might cause them trouble with advertisers, app stores, profitable users, or any number of other parties. In that light, one could read these clarifications as a useful free speech protection for porn producers. \nIndividuals involved or interested in the kink scene — enthusiasts, content creators, and beyond — have pointed out that Twitter’s explicit ban on depictions of sexual or sexualized violence blocks the free sexual expression of communities that engage in safe, consensual, and for many personally beneficial fetishes like flogging or consensual non-consent roleplaying. Twitter’s TOS asserts that it is reasonable and important to limit this sexual speech “to prevent the normalization of sexual assault and non-consensual violence associated with sexual acts.” This is a dubious, but at least clear and public, line of reasoning.\nA number of anti-censorship activists Mashable spoke to for this piece argued that Twitter’s current TOS are still worryingly vague. But social media companies often feel compelled to leave a little wiggle room in these texts to account for the infinite unknown unknowns of the internet. It is difficult to figure out the sweet spot between functional and dangerous vagueness. \nNo matter how helpful Twitter intended its clarifications to be, they sparked fear, in large part because of phrasing and delivery issues. Case in point, one line reads: “Your account may be permanently suspended if the majority of your activity on Twitter is sharing sensitive media.” Many in the porn world saw this as a notice of Twitter’s right — and implicitly its intent — to start taking down porn-centric accounts. But a Twitter rep told Mashable that they meant that “accounts that consistently share sensitive media that breaks our rules, or consistently share sensitive media in a way — unsolicited and targeted, in profile or header images — that breaks our rules” could face suspension. “Based on feedback that this line isn’t clear enough,” Twitter told Mashable after an interview on the topic, “we’ll be clarifying the policy.” On Tuesday, the company told Mashable that they've yet to change the TOS text because of the pandemic, saying, \"With COVID-19, our team's priorities shifted but we are still working to update that page with clarifying language.\"  \nThe looming shadow of shadow banning\nHowever Twitter’s clarifications did make it clear that the site reserves (and has always reserved) the right to limit the reach or visibility of any Tweet or account. Some observers read this as a long-awaited admission that Twitter engages in shadow banning, a term for making hashtags or handles invisible to anyone who doesn’t know exactly how to look for them, without notifying the targeted user or users. Performers and producers have long argued that Twitter shadow bans adult accounts, terms, and accounts that interact with them as a means of “essentially suffocating sex workers from being able to reach their fans,” as Rios puts it. “Each year, they add more levels of shadow banning.” \nTwitter has always balked at the term shadow ban. It has also long denied accusations that it uses shadow bans to suppress speech that doesn’t break its TOS but that the company or its backers disagree with or dislike, or to marginalize and discourage posting by irksome individuals. \nInstead the company says that it uses techy tools to spot “accounts that are engaging in what may be abusive or spammy behavior” then limits “certain account functionality, such as only distributing their Tweets to their followers.” The company also notes that its safe search mode automatically screens out “Tweets that contain potentially sensitive content” from conversations, searches, and timelines. It further specifies that the company is “constantly running experiments on Twitter, which may limit the reach of certain Tweets.” \nThis could explain a fair amount of purported porn-targeted shadow banning. As performer Alura Jenson acknowledges, while many porn performers and producers abide by Twitter’s rules, tons of unscrupulous accounts still “publicly force [pornographic] images and videos down the throats of the average Twitter user.” And Twitter has always had a problem with porn spam bots, automated accounts that use adult content and language to phish for users’ personal and payment information. These bots were especially active last year. “I blocked hundreds of spam accounts,” notes adult performer Ginger Banks. “The couple of years [before 2019] it was more like 10 or 20 a year.” \nTwitter has been ramping up its safeguards against abuse and spam, a rep told Mashable. In theory that should not lead to systematic problems for legitimate and compliant porn accounts. But Banks suspects there are enough similarities between what the above-board porn world tweets or does and what abusive or spam accounts do to cause difficulties. The legitimate industry may be getting caught in the crossfire of a well-intentioned user protection program. “The real kick in the teeth,” Jenson argues, “is that when genuine accounts get shadow banned, fraudulent and predatory accounts,” including fake accounts for banned performers, are often “still searchable. Fans tend to fall for these, succumbing to scams and [their] parasitic demands for money.” \nThe subtlety and opacity of content limitation (slash shadow banning) also makes it incredibly difficult for porn performers to know when their accounts, and thus their livelihoods, might be suffering from it and why, Jenson notes. Amberly Rothfield, a performer who consults on social media account building and management for other adult stars and publicly protests shadow banning, argues that the only logical explanation for Twitter’s lack of clarity on the specific content that leads to content limitation is the existence of an active, duplicitous, and sinister project aiming to slowly and silently squeeze adult content and its creators off of the platform. But it seems more likely that Twitter just doesn’t clarify everything that can lead to content limitation for fear that doing so would be a field guide for bad actors to use to game safeguards and harm users. \nWhat would a crackdown actually look like?\nEven if Twitter’s goals are all currently noble, Stabile argues this content limitation clause creates potential for future less honorable, more arbitrary and insidious suppression or bans. “Just having something on the books that allows people to censor or shut down things is concerning to us,” he explains. “People say, ‘It’s not going to be used this way,’ or, ‘It won’t affect you.’ What we’ve found historically, particularly with legislation but also at the corporate level, is that [blank checks like this] do get used. A new administration comes in. A press scandal arises. A financial incentive changes. And suddenly, well, you know.” Then adult content writ large is in the crosshairs. \n“These are the things we saw Tumblr do before going for the jugular” and fully banning adult content from its platform in December 2018, Stabile adds of the clarifications in Twitter’s current TOS. “The adult community in general is right to be nervous.” \nA few performers actually argue that a crackdown on adult content on Twitter could be a good thing for the industry. Sure, a sudden ban on all nude or sexual imagery might cause an initial shock, forcing every performer to spend weeks locking down and cleaning up their accounts, argues performer Jessy Dubai. Some may even lose accounts in the scrum and face the daunting task of rebuilding their follower bases from scratch. (A number of performers have told me that they’ve actually been preparing for this potential eventuality, creating secret SFW backup accounts that they'll switch over to as soon as their old accounts face new scrutiny or go dark.)\nYet, as Banks notes, performers often find that they develop a more loyal, considerate, and profitable fan base by posting only PG content on their Twitters — by using them purely for SFW interactions and personal brand building. DeVille notes that many stars can keep things clean enough to stay on Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat as well despite their crackdowns — and still get plenty of traffic from them. And the race to gain visibility and numbers on Twitter by posting the sort of explicit content that fans love, argues Dubai, just contributes to the industry’s free porn crisis. Cutting off the flow of explicit clips and pics on Twitter could, she suggests, force some people who depend on this sort of easily accessible promo material for their porn fixes to become paying customers and so help performers waste less time and earn more. \nHowever, implicit in these “it could be good for us” arguments is the idea that a crackdown on adult content would be transparent, fair, and consistent — three terms most performers would never apply to social media censorship enforcement. The feared risk of a crackdown is often less that Twitter will get rid of, say, pics of explicit penetration, and more that it will make haphazard, ill-informed, or secretly malicious and discriminatory judgements about when and how to apply vague, and as such potentially overbroad, new enforcement standards. (Twitter has long stressed that it allows anyone to appeal any actions it may take against their accounts or content. But this presumes that people know they have been targeted and so may not cover some forms of content limitation. Also, the availability of an appeals process does not always avoid harm or chilling effects for the targets. Just ask anyone subjected to an abusive SLAPP lawsuit in the United States.) \nRios argues that social media companies have historically been more permissive when applying their sex and nudity standards to pop stars, and more arbitrary or harsh when applying them to any sort of sex worker. Pelazzari and Stabile both argue that bias or ignorance on the part of users flagging and moderators reviewing content has always led nudity and sexuality censorship rules to have disproportionately severe — and often outright harmful — effects on sexual minorities. \nMajor porn stars believe they would be able to weather even a chaotic, severe, or even total war on adult content and workers on Twitter. They're able to shift their focus onto other social media accounts they are less worried about, or reach out to their well established fan bases via their web sites, cam chat rooms, or any other number of adult industry venues. And since Tumblr’s great porn apocalypse, a number of niche social media sites have attempted to bill themselves as fast growing, functional, and attractive mainstream alternatives with explicitly sex- and porn-positive outlooks. (Rios notes that AVN recently built its own monetizable social media platform, AVN Stars.) “Creating accounts on these alternative social media platforms will preserve a sense of survival for those feeling the Twitter pinch,” Jenson argues. “Every giant began as a novice.” \n“It’s not that things can’t be done elsewhere,” counters Stabile. “It’s just tremendously difficult.” Maintaining multiple accounts and fan bases across the internet is a time-consuming task, and may be infeasible for new, small, or marginalized creators who rely on Twitter as a potent central hub.   \nIn theory, some new and niche adult-friendly platforms could become hubs for adult performers, partially or fully replacing Twitter as an internal organizing and safety promotion tool at least. But none could fully replace Twitter, especially for brand and career building. As Rothfield notes, they don’t have the money or the manpower to expand. Most don’t even have an app. Even if they had the resources of a giant company like Pornhub (who seems to have no interest in this game), performer Karla Lane points out, most consumers wouldn’t want to have accounts on, much less publicly view, a site explicitly focused on or friendly to adult content. \nWhat people want is a one-site-fits-all platform, she argues, where they can view porn and engage with adult stars casually, with a veneer of deniability. A number of fans in countries that ban porn sites but allow Twitter, looking the other way on its porn content, would likely not be permitted to engage with these new platforms even if they did want to. Not even many art models, who might get booted from mainstream platforms in adult content clamp downs for nude photos, would want to be associated with a porn platform, argues adult star Sarah Russi. And to top it all off, Mel Magazine reports many new or niche platforms seem to have questionable TOS themselves. \nSo if the central, far-reaching, and socially acceptable hub of Twitter were to start seriously purging adult content or accounts from its platform — or to start seriously, if subtly, suppressing adult content or accounts — it would not cripple the adult industry. A few actors might not even feel a pinch. But it would be devastating to wide swathes of the adult world. \nRothfield is sure that small to mid-sized producers and performers would lose gobs of eyes and income. Stabile is sure that worker exploitation and endangerment would increase substantially. Performer and producer Lady Olivia Fyre is sure that it would seriously set back evolving public dialogue on sex work and sex workers’ rights. “I can’t overstate it,” stresses Stabile. “It really is a scary prospect.” \nThe ripple effects of a porn-pocalypse\nStabile also argues that if Twitter ever does seriously escalate restrictions on adult content, it should cause concern for more than just the porn world. “The adult industry is always the canary in the coal mines,” he argues. “We’re the ones they come after first. We’re a strawman for going after larger issues around sexuality, whether that’s LGBTQ, BDSM, or women’s issues. Because it is really not a huge jump from cracking down on porn to declaring a whole host of things obscene and pornographic. That’s the way that this has happened globally and historically.” \nIn the face of fears of this grim prospect, Twitter has always touted its commitment to free speech. And social media researcher Ysabel Gerrard points out that they certainly don’t seem to have any immediate interests or goals that would lead them to walk back that commitment in favor of limits on adult content or voices. “In Twitter’s summary of its latest transparency report,” she notes, the document in which it sets forth its key priorities, values, and concerns, “the company foregrounds issues like abuse, hate speech, and terrorism — the three biggest moderation-related criticisms currently leveled at the company. The summary page doesn’t even mention adult content.”  \nStill, this means the health and stability of the adult industry — and thus the safety and security of thousands of already marginalized workers — rides on Twitter continuing to honestly and diligently respect free speech for adult producers even though it has no legal obligation to do so and may face strong incentives to do otherwise in the future. Companies have demonstrated repeatedly that pressure from payment processors, investors, advertisers, or juicy potential markets can at times override respect for the speech and wellbeing of certain politically or financially unimportant groups, like porn stars.\nA number of reports also suggest that social media sites especially have been willing to step away from adult content — and certain types of wider sexual dialogue — entirely just to avoid the as of yet uncertain risk of legal trouble due to a poorly crafted and dangerous law passed in early 2018 by America’s Congress. (Known as FOSTA-SESTA, it holds online platforms liable for hosting user-created content that can be construed, broadly, as facilitating sex trafficking. Note that some anti-porn activists argue that all adult content does just that.) “It’s likely,” Pellazari, adds, “that the company would rather be criticized for restricting speech than for hosting a piece of content deemed violent or damaging” by powerful social or political actors or media figures. \n“All it takes,” argues Stabile, “is a new administration, or a political push, to make it happen… Everything is set up for this to happen. All that isn’t there now is the will to do it.” \nOnce that incentive arrives — that spark of censorship — “suddenly it all falls like dominoes.” \nPerformers Crystal Rush, Kimberly Chi, and Roxie Rae, and Suzanne Kelder of PervCity.com also shared their thoughts and insights for consideration in the research for this piece."},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1448298%252F1a28e409-59b2-48a7-a40b-b7613c4ab900.png%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.png?signature=DvJvBzE0BJkQn4w7r-V9eoIremI=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F117994%252Fe866fbdc-3f78-43da-aa42-0d3cbc738775.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=4wJ5YvkINWPqKaRR7jpS37viVu4=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F117994%252Fe866fbdc-3f78-43da-aa42-0d3cbc738775.jpg%252F280x158.jpg?signature=UwI_9PI2AVLlQzPmDFllipXW_P8=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"280x158#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F117994%252Fe866fbdc-3f78-43da-aa42-0d3cbc738775.jpg%252F560x316.jpg?signature=UBbrWa1tKTuQ7-3hcpatL9KSB_k=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution:

and old high school friends sharing fake coronavirus cures and anti-mask propaganda on Facebook. \nThe social media giant admitted the mind-boggling scale of COVID-19 misinformation flooding its platforms Tuesday in a statement to reporters. And, in perhaps what won't come as a surprise to the people who rely on Facebook and Instagram to get their daily news, the sites are drowning in it. \nFor starters, the company confirmed it removed more than 7 million \"pieces of harmful COVID-19 misinformation\" from both Facebook and Instagram in the months spanning April to June. Examples of which include posts pushing \"exaggerated cures\" and \"fake preventative measures.\" \nThat might include, although Facebook didn't specify, incorrect and possibly dangerous claims that hydroxychloroquine is a cure for COVID-19. Or, perhaps, suggestions to inject oneself with bleach? Oh yeah, and then there's the false claim — made by Donald Trump — that children are \"almost immune\" to COVID-19. \nFacebook didn't stop there. The company put \"warning labels\" on 98 million \"pieces of COVID-19 misinformation on Facebook\" in the same three months.\nThere are, of course, other forms of misinformation on Facebook and Instagram as well. For example, in the U.S. alone, from March to July Facebook removed 110,000 pieces of content \"that could mislead people about voting or try to intimidate them so they don’t vote.\"\nBut back to the coronavirus.  \n\"Today's report shows the impact of COVID-19 on our content moderation and demonstrates that, while our technology for identifying and removing violating content is improving, there will continue to be areas where we rely on people to both review content and train our technology,\" reads a statement from Emily Cain, a policy communications manager at Facebook, emailed to reporters.\nPutting firm numbers to what many assumed — that Facebook has a coronavirus misinformation problem — was just one of the many announcements made by the company Tuesday. Facebook also published three posts to its Newsroom page, all addressing varying aspects of its community standards and content review policies. \nSEE ALSO: Facebook removes Trump post for spreading COVID-19 misinformation \nThe first post announced Facebook's sixth Community Standards Enforcement Report. This report attempts to clearly communicate how Facebook enforced its community standards from April through June of this year. The second post tries to explain how Facebook reviews content (as opposed to what content had been reviewed). The third post, meanwhile, announces Facebook's intention to launch an ostensibly independent, third-party audit of its annual community standards enforcement reports. \nAs Tuesday's news makes clear, Facebook has either found or made itself the arbiter of public discourse for much of the internet.

As of Tuesday morning, every Twitter user has the power to dictate who can — and crucially, by extension, who can't — reply to their tweets. \nFor a brief moment last week it appeared Twitter had quietly made the feature available to everyone with an update to the iOS mobile app. But alas, it was not to be. The Verge confirmed that the release notes were pushed in error, and no new feature was immediately forthcoming. \nUntil today, that is. \nThe new settings, ostensibly targeted at ending the scourge that is reply guys, lets users drop their outgoing tweets into three different buckets. The first, and most familiar, is what many people have today: Anyone and everyone (who isn't blocked) can reply to a tweet. The second takes into consideration who the tweeter follows, as only that follow list can respond to a tweet. The third restriction makes it so only people tagged in the initial tweet can reply.\n\"Tweets with the latter two settings will be labeled and the reply icon will be grayed out for people who can't reply,\" Suzanne Xie, Twitter's director of product management, explained in a press release. \"People who can't reply will still be able to view, Retweet, Retweet with Comment, share, and like these Tweets.\"\n\nWhile these new settings are framed as reducing possible harassment, they themselves are not without controversy. As the ACLU pointed out in May, public officials (like one Donald Trump) might use such a feature for ill. \n\"[Public] officials would be violating the First Amendment if they were to use this tool to block speakers on any accounts they've opened up for public conversation in their roles as government actors,\" read a statement from the organization at the time. \"Nor should public officials use this tool to decide who can, or can't, reply to accounts they have opened up for requests for government assistance, which may be on the rise due to COVID-19.\"\nIn other words, what if Trump uses these settings to attack his political opponents while preventing them from replying? \nSEE ALSO: Twitter's 'no replies' feature could cause problems for Trump\nWhen reached for comment, a Twitter spokesperson confirmed that the new settings will be available to the president — along with everyone else. You'll be able to access them on iOS, Android, and twitter.com.\nNotably, when asked about Trump perhaps abusing the settings, the spokesperson pointed to the \"retweets with comments\" timeline as a way that people will be still able to engage with tweets from those who have limited reply options.  \nDon’t miss the Tweets about your Tweet.

The group, called “Official Q/Qanon,” had nearly 200,000 members at the time of its removal. Facebook said it took the page down on Tuesday.\nA Facebook spokesperson told Reuters that the group was banned over posts that repeatedly broke the platform’s rules on misinformation, harassment, and hate speech.\nBBC journalist Shayan Sardarizadeh points out that the “Official Q/Qanon” group received more than 10 million engagements across 500,000 posts during the first 7 months of 2020. The group spiked in membership in early March, just as the full-force of the coronavirus pandemic began to hit the United States.\nLook at how page likes went up after Covid hit. There's only one other QAnon Facebook group with more likes (215,000) and that one's still up. I just quickly had a look at the other BIG QAnon groups/pages and they're all still there; at least for now! Analysis via @crowdtangle pic.twitter.com/FnnQQXijtJ— Shayan Sardarizadeh (@Shayan86) August 7, 2020\n\nThe former members of that group won’t have to look far for a new online home for their conspiracy theories, however. There are still plenty of Facebook groups dedicated to QAnon on the platform, including one even bigger than the banned group, with more than 215,000 members. In its latest action, Facebook did not address other QAnon groups or content on its platform.\nIn May, Facebook removed a network of QAnon pages, groups, and profiles for coordinated inauthentic behavior, its term for users who create multiple fake accounts to game its engagement algorithm. The removals marked the first time the social media company took action against accounts related to the conspiracy theory. \nOther social media platforms have taken even more serious approaches when it comes to QAnon. \nJust two weeks ago, Twitter announced that it would block QAnon-related links from its platform. The company also said it would block QAnon content from its trends and recommendations sections. Shortly after Twitter’s announcement, TikTok also blocked QAnon-related terms and content from its search engine. In 2018, Reddit banned a number of QAnon subreddits, including its biggest.\nCelebrities such as Chrissy Tiegen have complained of coordinated mass online harassment from QAnon believers.\nQAnon is a far-right-wing conspiracy theory. Its followers believe that Donald Trump is secretly working to take down a global child-trafficking ring run by satanic pedophiles in Hollywood and the Democratic Party. Various other conspiracy theories have been rolled into QAnon, such as fringe elements from the anti-vaccine communities.\nThe conspiracy began in 2017 when an anonymous internet user going by the name “Q” began posting on 4Chan about a secret plot by the supposed “deep state” to take down President Trump. Conspiracy theorists believe that Q is an individual close to Trump and the conspiracy has continued to grow regardless of the fact that all of Q’s predictions have been wrong."},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1440578%252Feccc7bd2-886d-47ea-839d-8153fcdf648c.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=_w5n987M1m61jMeQYlEONHThjXc=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F117908%252F3622ddca-a1d2-4914-b5fe-5e3888c9018e.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=tIDZQuUV5-OZ_ZxhPA6eoWWCUOM=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F117908%252F3622ddca-a1d2-4914-b5fe-5e3888c9018e.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=LjLThZFsp4gIKyM0IDe2X7z67Yc=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F117908%252F3622ddca-a1d2-4914-b5fe-5e3888c9018e.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=2gs7x0oi32uE8tarM9HcEGTI4hA=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F117908%252F3622ddca-a1d2-4914-b5fe-5e3888c9018e.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=IDxKTSThvW_ekwiZNfBx5qMSOWA=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F117908%252F3622ddca-a1d2-4914-b5fe-5e3888c9018e.jpg%252F560x314.jpg?signature=F1-Fvf23XuheJ1jmrvyfBYEW9J8=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"class":"microcontent","alt":"Facebook removed the second biggest QAnon-related group from its platform this week.","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/lead-img-facebook-removes-qanon-group.jpg","data":{"fragment":"lead-image","url":null,"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/lead-img-facebook-removes-qanon-group.jpg","micro":1},"src_type":"jpg","loading":"lazy","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1440578%252Feccc7bd2-886d-47ea-839d-8153fcdf648c.jpg%252F280x157__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=eoZg_4CbHAhAIBuS-Q05q1OpL64=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1440578%252Feccc7bd2-886d-47ea-839d-8153fcdf648c.jpg%252F356x205__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=kPoeXw9PRUEunoRTq71qd-ssYs4=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":{"tag_attributes":{"class":"image-caption","content":"Facebook removed the second biggest QAnon-related group from its platform this week."}},"image_credit_info":{"tag_attributes":{"class":"image-credit","content":"Image:  Sean Rayford/Getty Images"}},"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":{}},"display_title":"Facebook just banned one of its biggest QAnon groups","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"The group had nearly 200,000 members.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Tech/","tweet_text":"Facebook just banned one of its biggest QAnon groups"},{"_id":"5f2d188d99bfce0036000017","id":"/shopping/aug-7-digital-marketing-growth-hacking-certification-sale/","title":"Learn how to succeed in digital marketing with these online classes","title_tag":null,"author":"StackCommerce","post_date":"2020-08-07T09:00:00+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Fri, 07 Aug 2020 09:00:00 +0000","formatted_date":"08/07/2020","sort_key":"1K3Yek","link":"https://mashable.com/shopping/aug-7-digital-marketing-growth-hacking-certification-sale/","content":{"plain":"TL;DR: Learn to build your online presence with the Complete Digital Marketing Growth Hacking Certification bundle for $34.99, a 97% savings as of Aug. 7. \n\nContrary to what it seems, digital marketing goes way beyond posting on Facebook and getting listed in Google. If you're going to succeed as a marketer in 2020, knowledge of search engine optimization (SEO), paid ads, and even SMS alerts should be on your résumé. These tools and techniques all help accomplish one common goal: being able to increase sales for your brand. If you're committed to being at the top of your career game, the Complete Digital Marketing Growth Hacking Certification Bundle can get you up to speed and it will only cost you $34.99. \nThis nine-part course is taught by some of the best in the business. Entrepreneur and marketing innovator Benjamin Wilson will kick things off, and later, marketing creative Matt Jensen is set to take charge along with a number of other top-rated instructors.\nIn total, the bundle features 41 hours of marketing lessons on Facebook, YouTube, Google, Amazon, and more. First up, you'll begin with the Certified Facebook Marketing 2020 lesson, which offers a step-by-step guide to simple strategies for gaining targeted followers that will eventually lead to sales. Next, you'll move onto a crash course on Google Tag Manager that covers its importance and exactly how to use it. \nPerhaps the most essential course is the Complete Growth Hacking and Conversion Course, which covers everything from optimizing CTAs to retargeting interested shoppers. If you're serious about truly growing your online presence, you'll need to take note of these strategies.\nIf you already know what strategies and platforms you want to target first, you may choose to skip around and tackle the Go Viral on YouTube hour-long lecture or the SEO link building course. There is even a full course on Pinterest marketing.\nFinally, the Amazon FBA closes out the course package by outlining how you can start a business utilizing Amazon's tools and make it successful — which many sellers fail to do. \nWith nine courses in total, it's no surprise that this bundle is worth over a grand in value. But you can go after your marketing dreams and snag access for just $34.99.\n\n            \n              \n                \n              \n            \n            \n              The Complete

Specifically, up to $12. \nPast users of the now-defunct social media platform were hipped to a potential windfall Tuesday morning by an ominous looking email that helpfully assured wary recipients: \"You are not being sued.\" At issue is at least one \"bug\" which revealed non-public user data to third-party developers, and a resulting class-action lawsuit. \nAccording to the litigation website, you may qualify for a piece of the $7.5 million settlement if you are in the U.S., had a consumer Google+ account between January 1, 2015 and April 2, 2019, and had your \"non-public Profile Information exposed as a result of the software bugs Google announced on October 8, 2018 and December 10, 2018.\"\nYou have until Oct. 8, 2020, to file, and can do so here. \nNow, as is often the case with these things (remember Equifax?), there are a few important caveats. For starters, whether or not you get 12 whole dollars depends on how many people file a claim. As the the settlement info page explains, $12 is the maximum amount you may receive. You might just get pennies.\nSEE ALSO: Google to kill Google+ early after exposing personal data of more than 50 million\nAlso, the settlement needs to get final approval by the courts. That decision will be made on Nov. 19, but as it has already been granted preliminary approval, it should (theoretically) be approved with little fuss. \nSo fill out your claim, maybe get your $12, and then happily forget you ever willingly handed over your personal data to Google+ in the first place. "},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F117731%252Fd370b298-3afe-492d-a62e-08c0c43b55b1.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=6gyu7fXQMS4zhY1_yYGZ2K-ZoqY=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F117731%252Fd370b298-3afe-492d-a62e-08c0c43b55b1.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=RYCtlWWwmmYBPTW36pD0X_kcMk8=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F117731%252Fd370b298-3afe-492d-a62e-08c0c43b55b1.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=NYa8X39mbF04CmsG3ujAPeXZ-DQ=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F117731%252Fd370b298-3afe-492d-a62e-08c0c43b55b1.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=XXzykT_Z_ogg-9agiUiftGv57SA=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F117731%252Fd370b298-3afe-492d-a62e-08c0c43b55b1.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=Gl-RCpb3AFtsvXO0PE5DPqj9W2M=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F117731%252Fd370b298-3afe-492d-a62e-08c0c43b55b1.jpg%252F560x314.jpg?signature=S99WRhJV-PN9DeKKXfQEFGQQgZw=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"Google+ finally good for something: Getting you $12 (maybe)","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F117731%252Fd370b298-3afe-492d-a62e-08c0c43b55b1.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=NYa8X39mbF04CmsG3ujAPeXZ-DQ=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"jpg","loading":"lazy","version_webp_srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F117731%252Fd370b298-3afe-492d-a62e-08c0c43b55b1.webp%252F280x157.webp?signature=5GDF_4sBlEscOPWZAg7jeWVVv2Q=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F117731%252Fd370b298-3afe-492d-a62e-08c0c43b55b1.webp%252F356x205.webp?signature=QXRH6Bqn09DrcN8sLm7CykolEZ0=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F117731%252Fd370b298-3afe-492d-a62e-08c0c43b55b1.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=Gl-RCpb3AFtsvXO0PE5DPqj9W2M=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F117731%252Fd370b298-3afe-492d-a62e-08c0c43b55b1.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=NYa8X39mbF04CmsG3ujAPeXZ-DQ=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":{}},"display_title":"Google+ finally good for something: Getting you $12 (maybe)","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"If Google+ exposed your personal data, you have until Oct. 8 to file a claim.

The Federal Trade Commission apparently didn't take kindly to that, and sent a draft complaint Twitter's way on July 28.\nFor those blessed to not remember every single Twitter privacy scandal, it's worth a reminder just how problematic the 2019 revelation that Twitter matched some users to advertisers' marketing lists based on their 2FA numbers actually was. \nSpecifically, privacy experts noted that using phone numbers volunteered for security reasons for advertising represents a fundamental betrayal of trust. And that betrayal comes with real consequences.  \n\"Twitter 'unintentionally' used the information it got from you to secure your account in order to make money,\" Eva Galperin, the EFF's director of cybersecurity, wrote at the time. \"This kind of behavior undermines people's willingness to use 2FA and makes them less secure in the long run.\"\nIt also, according to Twitter's Monday filing, might just so happen to violate the company's 2011 FTC consent order. \n\"In March 2011, to resolve an investigation into various incidents, we entered into a consent order with the FTC that, among other things, required us to establish an information security program designed to protect non-public consumer information and also requires that we obtain biennial independent security assessments,\" reads the 10Q filing. \"[On] July 28, 2020, we received a draft complaint from the FTC alleging violations of the 2011 consent order with the FTC and the FTC Act.\" \nSEE ALSO: Not even Jack Dorsey can figure out how to use Periscope\nTwitter says the matter \"remains unresolved,\" and estimates the \"probable loss in this matter is $150.0 million to $250.0 million.\"\nWhether such a fine would be enough to prevent similar privacy mistakes in the future is anyone's guess, but it would at least be a start. \nWATCH: It's surprisingly easy to be more secure online"},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1434008%252F22a55e85-8fd5-40d8-8843-de45e84342c7.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=XzfVFGoidwKRln2lt4PKsDrGjBk=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F117694%252F6740aec0-d399-49a3-adf7-efa31757c638.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=yA2xSLFb9w7p4Lto4G6d7dk5uRI=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F117694%252F6740aec0-d399-49a3-adf7-efa31757c638.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=Rkq7bYh_FfvxqFnxa227CzYMYv4=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F117694%252F6740aec0-d399-49a3-adf7-efa31757c638.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=uKdtr_4kZVdF9a9RH0LoZnn0rpU=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F117694%252F6740aec0-d399-49a3-adf7-efa31757c638.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=fXyZG9EVogCkpBkQJPUipdlza9w=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F117694%252F6740aec0-d399-49a3-adf7-efa31757c638.jpg%252F560x314.jpg?signature=lPV-ktedbE1JzWdYUDKAu20wcR4=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"class":"microcontent","alt":"Oops!","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/lead-img-twitter-ftc-investigation-fines-250-million-2fa-advertising.jpg","data":{"fragment":"lead-image","url":null,"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/lead-img-twitter-ftc-investigation-fines-250-million-2fa-advertising.jpg","micro":1},"src_type":"jpg","loading":"lazy","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1434008%252F22a55e85-8fd5-40d8-8843-de45e84342c7.jpg%252F280x157__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=SdlO5T1fXzcU7OrgeF1icbQ9RJc=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1434008%252F22a55e85-8fd5-40d8-8843-de45e84342c7.jpg%252F356x205__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=7X86FOwR5cknGB_eWzPFBzUuae8=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":{"tag_attributes":{"class":"image-caption","content":"Oops!"}},"image_credit_info":{"tag_attributes":{"class":"image-credit","content":"Image:  Vicky Leta / mashable"}},"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":{}},"display_title":"Twitter may have to pay hundreds of millions in fines for privacy screw-up","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"360OeJxglV","data-source":"blueprint"}],"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"At issue is the 2019 revelation that Twitter used some users' phone numbers for advertising, even though they were submitted for security purposes.

Good luck with that.\n\"What's Triller?\" the spokesperson reportedly replied. \nSuch a response suggests that if Triller does end up buying TikTok's U.S. assets, it won't be because TikTok viewed the deal as a match made in digital heaven."},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118713%252F1f8c1363-ebb9-499d-a7ee-1e606fd02485.png%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.png?signature=ke80B0Ci4i9IV92HbMU8QZi35RE=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118713%252F1f8c1363-ebb9-499d-a7ee-1e606fd02485.png%252F1438x0.png?signature=-2_IEAU4q4LUYO4WkJZa1VcysGM=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118713%252F1f8c1363-ebb9-499d-a7ee-1e606fd02485.png%252F356x205.png?signature=ONY7uWDcdX6WnPvhl9zia9b32jI=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118713%252F1f8c1363-ebb9-499d-a7ee-1e606fd02485.png%252F712x410.png?signature=S-wM7WMevXdSJyLLyBMbvRmuaGM=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118713%252F1f8c1363-ebb9-499d-a7ee-1e606fd02485.png%252F280x157.png?signature=62BsHwlFQHRZBpSfzGgIC__XkXg=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118713%252F1f8c1363-ebb9-499d-a7ee-1e606fd02485.png%252F560x314.png?signature=3vUegtWuorETS32SkCmG33UhUrc=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"And now Triller is trying to buy U.S. TikTok, report claims","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118713%252F1f8c1363-ebb9-499d-a7ee-1e606fd02485.png%252F356x205.png?signature=ONY7uWDcdX6WnPvhl9zia9b32jI=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"png","loading":"lazy","version_webp_srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118713%252F1f8c1363-ebb9-499d-a7ee-1e606fd02485.webp%252F280x157.webp?signature=ABlfkr9mM8wk19hbMSars6zn1mU=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118713%252F1f8c1363-ebb9-499d-a7ee-1e606fd02485.webp%252F356x205.webp?signature=CTKI-tBUFOvYRtgrF50NSnCT-w8=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118713%252F1f8c1363-ebb9-499d-a7ee-1e606fd02485.png%252F280x157.png?signature=62BsHwlFQHRZBpSfzGgIC__XkXg=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118713%252F1f8c1363-ebb9-499d-a7ee-1e606fd02485.png%252F356x205.png?signature=ONY7uWDcdX6WnPvhl9zia9b32jI=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":{}},"display_title":"And now Triller is trying to buy U.S. TikTok, report claims","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"Triller joins an ever-growing list of companies trying to get a piece of that TikTok pie.

The term is used to describe the act of scrolling through social media feeds and consuming a seemingly endless amount of concerning news. If you're anything like me, you enjoy being in the know at all times, and news-related FOMO makes you reluctant to unplug from social media. So doomscrolling can be a hard habit to break.\nWanting to stay informed is totally understandable, but there are ways to do so that don't take as large of a toll on your mental health as doomscrolling does. In an effort to help our fellow doomscrollers cut back on the potentially harmful habit, we've compiled a comprehensive list of practical steps you can take to stop doomscrolling. We hope these suggestions help, and remember: It's OK to be offline every now and again.\n1. Reorganize the apps on your phone\nIf you're looking to start small, reorganizing the apps on your device is a simple way to put a little bit of distance between you and your social media feeds.\nRather than keeping popular apps like Twitter and Instagram (or anything you don't want to use as often) on your homepage, move them to the third or fourth page of your device so you have to do some work to access them. I personally keep my Twitter app on the last page of my iPhone in a folder labeled \"Don't Touch,\" and though I still use it often, the setup does makes me think twice before clicking and occasionally persuades me to reevaluate.\n\nAn editor of mine also suggested periodically deleting social media apps from your phone. Doing so will hopefully help you check the platforms less frequently, since you'll only be accessing them on desktop.\n2. Set usage limits and be aware of your screen time\nIf you're not in the mood to reorganize your apps (or have done so and are now looking to take some extra steps) consider setting time limits for the usage of certain apps.\nIf there's a specific app you're looking to cut back on, see if there's a way to add usage restrictions within the platform. For instance, Instagram lets you manage your activity. All you have to do is go to your profile on the app and click the three lines in the upper right hand corner of your screen. After doing so, select \"Your Activity\" and \"Set Daily Reminder.\" You can choose an amount of time between five minutes and 23 hours and 55 minutes (lmao.) Then, after you've used up your daily Instagram minutes the app will alert you so you can cut back on usage.\n\nIf you have an iPhone, iPad, or Mac, you can also use Screen Time. The feature allows you to monitor how often you use your screen, see which apps you spend the most time on, and set daily time limits for them. You can also use Screen Time's \"Downtime\" feature to set scheduled time away from your screen. \"During downtime, only apps that you choose to allow and phone calls will be available,\" the setting reads.\nGoogle's Digital Wellbeing was also created to help people manage their tech usage and find a healthy balance between online and offline life. You can learn more information about your tech habits, along with tips on how to focus and tools to help you unplug on wellbeing.google. And if you need to stop scrolling social media on your phone and desktop, the website blocker, Freedom, can help, too. You can test out the service with a free trial, and there are also several free browser extensions available for download. (Compatible with Mac, Windows, iOD, Android, Chromebook, and Linux.)\n\nIf you're not into app-specific time limits, consider setting a daily alarm to remind yourself to unplug. For instance, if a \"Stop Doomscrolling\" alarm goes off at 9:00 p.m. and tells you to unplug, you might remember to enjoy the rest of your night social media free. Doesn't that sound lovely?\n3. Switch to a Good Screen (or abandon screens all together)\nAfter a long day of being online, I consider any screen that displays social media to be Bad. Good screens include televisions, e-book readers, and gaming consoles — but laptops and phones have the ability to be good depending on their purpose.\nInstead of wasting hours doomscrolling, use your devices for something fun! Catch up on some television shows, shop, play a video game, and read or write for pleasure. \nAnother great way to ensure you don't spiral into another doomscrolling session is to do something that doesn't involve a screen at all. Read a physical book. Take a walk. Safely catch up with friends and family members. Try paint-by-numbers. Practice some self-care. Finding hobbies and activities that bring you joy and separate you from social media is important. \n4. Physically distance yourself from your screens\nIf you're still struggling to restrict your social media usage, consider taking slightly more drastic measures.\nFor starters, try turning the volume on and leaving your phone in a different room whenever you feel you need a break. You won't check it as frequently, but you'll still be able to hear any incoming messages or calls.\nYou can also consider buying a phone case with a cover on it, like these, in hopes of making less eye contact with your screen. And I highly recommend downloading a productivity app, such as Forest, which locks your screen for a set amount of time. The app discourages you from checking your phone by planting a cute virtual tree that will only grow to completion if your phone remains locked for the set time. The app holding you accountable is definitely encouraging.\n\nIf you haven't already, you should also make an effort to sleep apart from your phone and other tech devices. Earlier this year, I tried sleeping in a separate room as my phone for a week and though the separation admittedly took some getting used to, falling asleep and waking up without social media at my fingertips was truly refreshing.\nIf you rely on your phone to wake you up every morning, it's time to take the plunge and splurge on a real alarm clock. If you love tech but are trying to cut screens out of your room entirely, the Loftie Clock is the perfect alarm for you. It's a bit pricey (you can pre-order one for $129) but the clock offers a bunch of phone-related perks without all the distractions of social media.\n\n5. Switch up the ways in which you consume news\nFollowing trusted sources and having the ability to see trending topics in the area of your choosing makes it possible to get the majority of your news from social media. In some ways, that's convenient. But the constant consumption of news, updates, and opinions also makes logging off difficult.\nIn an attempt to start using social media less, try using other news sources more. Instead of spending hours on your timeline, try visiting platforms like Apple News and Flipboard to get straight news without all the other distractions of social media. You can also sign up for informative newsletters and set aside time in your day to watch the news and catch up on what you missed. (Just remember to turn it off after an hour or two and unwind for the rest of the night.)\nIf you're searching for more instant information gratification, sign up for some breaking news alerts or enable social media notifications for select users. This way, you can stay in-the-know without having to scroll all the time.\nWe're in the middle of a global pandemic and only months away from the U.S. presidential election, so every social media scroll is bound to feature some level of doom. But if you make an honest effort to cut back on doomscrolling, you'll definitely have more time in your day to experience moments of genuine joy."},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1447409%252Fe91c3a43-3aae-4234-abe8-5988b3fe93d1.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=2EgN7CVZUf4uU0yqYdWYkBi9zco=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F117966%252F4f5a02ba-6957-41f2-ba0e-2693f88bacf5.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=0LtTvNOfcTOBrIleD4uDYYvVACk=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F117966%252F4f5a02ba-6957-41f2-ba0e-2693f88bacf5.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=Bm4uhCtWEp6DigtasekhosJ8a84=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F117966%252F4f5a02ba-6957-41f2-ba0e-2693f88bacf5.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=N_8qcoV2WO5OKRCt-ImjGhmVRLU=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F117966%252F4f5a02ba-6957-41f2-ba0e-2693f88bacf5.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=hAifSSLuld9Nw8sWlV9b4w8MOpI=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F117966%252F4f5a02ba-6957-41f2-ba0e-2693f88bacf5.jpg%252F560x314.jpg?signature=12SNOoi3nl1ZAm4A0rSJQmah0JI=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"5 practical ways to cut back on doomscrolling","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F117966%252F4f5a02ba-6957-41f2-ba0e-2693f88bacf5.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=Bm4uhCtWEp6DigtasekhosJ8a84=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"jpg","loading":"lazy","version_webp_srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F117966%252F4f5a02ba-6957-41f2-ba0e-2693f88bacf5.webp%252F280x157.webp?signature=mVZbjgbc5UfHYc6cOj1NjuT9KYw=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F117966%252F4f5a02ba-6957-41f2-ba0e-2693f88bacf5.webp%252F356x205.webp?signature=kyr-d701LZ3Su1lpqiDrtlNRUII=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F117966%252F4f5a02ba-6957-41f2-ba0e-2693f88bacf5.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=hAifSSLuld9Nw8sWlV9b4w8MOpI=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F117966%252F4f5a02ba-6957-41f2-ba0e-2693f88bacf5.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=Bm4uhCtWEp6DigtasekhosJ8a84=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":{}},"display_title":"5 practical ways to cut back on doomscrolling","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"gElYVYG8oQ","data-source":"blueprint"}],"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"We've all had enough doom.

A number of porn performers and producers promptly went into panic mode, decrying or lamenting this impending death blow.\nThese concerns, it appears, were overblown. We're more than halfway through this year, and there are no signs of a major shift, much less a crackdown. In fact, Twitter tells Mashable that it has not changed, nor does it plan to change, its policies on sensitive media (its euphemism for violent and adult content), or the way it enforces those policies. \nThis wasn't the first time a major wave of Twitter-related paranoia has swept the industry. Similar reports about an oncoming all-out war on porn made the rounds in 2015 and 2017, and notably never amount to much either. \nBut the level of concern this coverage stoked just demonstrates how vital Twitter has become — and how devastating its loss would be — to the health and stability of the adult industry. \nAnd even if a crackdown is not on its way in the short term — a near certainty especially in our current state of pandemic-induced suspended animation — many social media and adult industry experts still believe those working in the porn have good reason to fear an eventual Twitter porn-pocalypse.  \nPorn's social media revolution\nAbout a decade ago, tube sites offering free porn took off, and the bottom fell out of the old school porn industry. Around the same time, the democratization of online video production, shifts in the way many people think about sex and sexuality, and a host of other factors led to a spike in the number of people making amateur or indie studio porn — or even dipping their toes into mainstream porn production. \nFacing increasing competition for a decreasing pool of paying customers, many porn performers and producers gradually realized that they needed to build strong brands and deep connections with loyal fanbases — to be more connected and personified — to survive or thrive. So naturally, they turned to social media, a tool custom built for that sort of outreach and marketing. \nFor years now, performers and producers have used mainstream social media to send out a constant stream of humanizing slice-of-life photos and videos. These platforms have also allowed them to interact directly (and often pithily and effectively) with their fans. As (usually non-sexual) porn performer and publicist James Bartholet notes, studios (some of whom have started shooting scenes again after months of pandemic-related production holds) now look at performers’ follower counts to figure out who has a large fan base they can market to (or piggyback off of), and thus who to hire. The bulk of these studios’ advertising to those fan bases whenever they release new titles plays out on social media, as well. Ditto for strip clubs (some of which have also reopened), which shell out higher rates for feature dances from performers they believe will draw a crowd. \nPerformers also directly monetize their social media followings. Some create private or locked accounts then sell access to fans who crave a sense of intimacy and connection with these idealized icons. Most drive loyal fans from their public social media accounts to their personal sites, or to platforms like Clips4Sale, ManyVids, and the increasingly popular and visible OnlyFans, where they sell often custom-made clips or subscriptions that give fans access to a constant flow of usually self-created and well protected content with a lot of personality baked into it. \nMany performers and producers get close to 100 percent of their traffic from social media referrals. As such, social media has been essential, notes Heather Berg, who studies modern porn work, to the rise of profitable independent porn stars. Most of them work safely and on their own terms “without paying high fees to managers and third-party processors.” (These types of stars are also the ones who've best weathered the restrictions and upheavals of the pandemic.) \nSurviving by the grace of social media has its risks, however. A number of performers have told me in recent years that porn used to be like a nine-to-five job; they could turn off their onscreen personas, industry drama, and fan chatter and critiques when they went off the clock. Now, they say, they often feel like they have to be on — and exposed to brutal vitriol of trolls and entitlement of keyboard warrior fans — all the time. As it is for other influencers, this constant pressure and feedback can be grueling \nBut, argues Mike Stabile of the Free Speech Coalition, an industry group originally founded 29 years ago to fight obscenity and censorship laws, social media has also made the industry safer. \n“Adult performers use it to call out bad producers, to warn people about… exploitation” with a freedom, reach, and volume amplification they never could before, he says. “For the FSC, we use it to get out information about production holds” after one or more performers test positive for an STI, “report bad actors or policy changes, put out alerts about fraud attempts,” and much more. It is especially useful, he says, for reaching performers who don’t live in Los Angeles, porn’s old (and increasingly irrelevant) physical capital, or work in traditional studios and so would be hard to contact through conventional means. \nLeya Tanit, a performer and founder of Pineapple Support, which offers mental health education and does outreach to set adult stars up with services, explains that their team uses social media to keep an eye out for, and offer support to, marginalized or isolated performers who seem to be struggling. \nSocial media platforms have also made it easier for porn industry figures to organize politically and share their stories with the mainstream press and broader public, Stabile adds. “I don’t think the awareness around … sex worker rights would be where it is” without social media, he says. \nThe problem with platforms\nFor about five years, Twitter has been by far the most important social media platform for the porn world, if only because it has been the least hostile to it — and to discussions and depictions of sex and sexuality in general. Facebook and Instagram have squeezed nudity, and many forms of sexual conversation, off of their platforms to the point that last fall the former started censoring eggplant and peach emojis in certain types of user posts and conversations. \nTumblr, once a haven for erotic talk and imagery, especially for minority sexual communities, fully banned adult content in December 2018. And performers allege that Snapchat, despite its origins as a thoroughly sext-focused app, has periodically targeted their accounts for censorship, or just fully purged them, for years. \nMost of these platforms make allowances for moderate sexual dialogue, especially in educational, artistic, or documentary materials. But everyone from non-pornographic artists and models to pole dancers to sexual educators (especially in the queer community) claim that most platforms are overzealous at best in their enforcement, often censoring even what should be allowed, and is by almost any reasonable standard innocuous, sexual (if perhaps vaguely sexualizable) content. \nPorn stars especially argue that these platforms frequently target them with over-harsh enforcement, and often outright bans, even when they play by the rules. Notably, last fall a performer’s group documented over 1,000 instances in which Instagram allegedly deleted adult stars’ accounts even when they complied with community guidelines restricting the display or discussion of sex or nudity.\n“Every year, we are seeing more and more discrimination towards sex workers on all of the major social media platforms,” argues Tony Rios, president of the porn trade media house AVN.\nExcept for Twitter, that is. They have long banned nudity and simulated or unstimulated sex acts in profile photos and header images. They require posters to mark any tweets containing adult content, or accounts that frequently feature such material, as sensitive. And they have banned the delivery of unsolicited messages containing sensitive content to others. These are all fairly reasonable efforts to keep people who don’t want to see adult content on Twitter from chancing upon it incidentally. \nBut despite banning adult content on Vine (which they owned) in 2014, they’ve refrained from enacting restrictions anywhere near as stringent as the other social media giants. In fact Twitter has been so friendly to porn performers and producers by comparison that anti-porn groups like Fight The New Drug and the National Center on Sexual Exploitation treat it as one of the greatest abettors of what they see as a leading global health and safety menace.  \nThe fact that Twitter has held out for so long as a porn-friendly space while the rest of the social media world has turned away from sex and sexuality leaves porn stars waiting for what many feel is an inevitable cave in and crackdown, explains adult star Cherie DeVille. Hence the mild-to-major industry panic and suspicion anytime Twitter makes literally any move even vaguely related to sexual content or discourse, whether that’s adjusting its policies or going after spam bots. \nReading between the lines of the terms of service\nThe recent panic seemingly started when Twitter announced that it would amend its policies at the start of 2020 to comply with new privacy laws in California and the European Union. This led a number of users to dive into the platform’s terms of service (TOS), where they noticed what seemed like new restrictions on sensitive media. Commentators focused especially on the fact that Twitter’s TOS list depictions of “bodily fluids, including blood, feces, [and] semen” within their definition depictions of graphic violence, explicitly forbid any depiction of simulated or actual sexual or sexualized violence in any context, and feature a line about a policy on censoring accounts dedicated to sharing sensitive media. Twitter had actually seemingly slipped this language into its TOS months earlier in an attempt to add clarity to old rules, not to substantively alter them. \nAnti-censorship activists have been concerned about vague social media TOS since platforms like Twitter launched, notes Nora Pelazzari of the National Coalition Against Censorship, arguing that they can and do use ambiguity as a blank check to restrict all manner of speech that might cause them trouble with advertisers, app stores, profitable users, or any number of other parties. In that light, one could read these clarifications as a useful free speech protection for porn producers. \nIndividuals involved or interested in the kink scene — enthusiasts, content creators, and beyond — have pointed out that Twitter’s explicit ban on depictions of sexual or sexualized violence blocks the free sexual expression of communities that engage in safe, consensual, and for many personally beneficial fetishes like flogging or consensual non-consent roleplaying. Twitter’s TOS asserts that it is reasonable and important to limit this sexual speech “to prevent the normalization of sexual assault and non-consensual violence associated with sexual acts.” This is a dubious, but at least clear and public, line of reasoning.\nA number of anti-censorship activists Mashable spoke to for this piece argued that Twitter’s current TOS are still worryingly vague. But social media companies often feel compelled to leave a little wiggle room in these texts to account for the infinite unknown unknowns of the internet. It is difficult to figure out the sweet spot between functional and dangerous vagueness. \nNo matter how helpful Twitter intended its clarifications to be, they sparked fear, in large part because of phrasing and delivery issues. Case in point, one line reads: “Your account may be permanently suspended if the majority of your activity on Twitter is sharing sensitive media.” Many in the porn world saw this as a notice of Twitter’s right — and implicitly its intent — to start taking down porn-centric accounts. But a Twitter rep told Mashable that they meant that “accounts that consistently share sensitive media that breaks our rules, or consistently share sensitive media in a way — unsolicited and targeted, in profile or header images — that breaks our rules” could face suspension. “Based on feedback that this line isn’t clear enough,” Twitter told Mashable after an interview on the topic, “we’ll be clarifying the policy.” On Tuesday, the company told Mashable that they've yet to change the TOS text because of the pandemic, saying, \"With COVID-19, our team's priorities shifted but we are still working to update that page with clarifying language.\"  \nThe looming shadow of shadow banning\nHowever Twitter’s clarifications did make it clear that the site reserves (and has always reserved) the right to limit the reach or visibility of any Tweet or account. Some observers read this as a long-awaited admission that Twitter engages in shadow banning, a term for making hashtags or handles invisible to anyone who doesn’t know exactly how to look for them, without notifying the targeted user or users. Performers and producers have long argued that Twitter shadow bans adult accounts, terms, and accounts that interact with them as a means of “essentially suffocating sex workers from being able to reach their fans,” as Rios puts it. “Each year, they add more levels of shadow banning.” \nTwitter has always balked at the term shadow ban. It has also long denied accusations that it uses shadow bans to suppress speech that doesn’t break its TOS but that the company or its backers disagree with or dislike, or to marginalize and discourage posting by irksome individuals. \nInstead the company says that it uses techy tools to spot “accounts that are engaging in what may be abusive or spammy behavior” then limits “certain account functionality, such as only distributing their Tweets to their followers.” The company also notes that its safe search mode automatically screens out “Tweets that contain potentially sensitive content” from conversations, searches, and timelines. It further specifies that the company is “constantly running experiments on Twitter, which may limit the reach of certain Tweets.” \nThis could explain a fair amount of purported porn-targeted shadow banning. As performer Alura Jenson acknowledges, while many porn performers and producers abide by Twitter’s rules, tons of unscrupulous accounts still “publicly force [pornographic] images and videos down the throats of the average Twitter user.” And Twitter has always had a problem with porn spam bots, automated accounts that use adult content and language to phish for users’ personal and payment information. These bots were especially active last year. “I blocked hundreds of spam accounts,” notes adult performer Ginger Banks. “The couple of years [before 2019] it was more like 10 or 20 a year.” \nTwitter has been ramping up its safeguards against abuse and spam, a rep told Mashable. In theory that should not lead to systematic problems for legitimate and compliant porn accounts. But Banks suspects there are enough similarities between what the above-board porn world tweets or does and what abusive or spam accounts do to cause difficulties. The legitimate industry may be getting caught in the crossfire of a well-intentioned user protection program. “The real kick in the teeth,” Jenson argues, “is that when genuine accounts get shadow banned, fraudulent and predatory accounts,” including fake accounts for banned performers, are often “still searchable. Fans tend to fall for these, succumbing to scams and [their] parasitic demands for money.” \nThe subtlety and opacity of content limitation (slash shadow banning) also makes it incredibly difficult for porn performers to know when their accounts, and thus their livelihoods, might be suffering from it and why, Jenson notes. Amberly Rothfield, a performer who consults on social media account building and management for other adult stars and publicly protests shadow banning, argues that the only logical explanation for Twitter’s lack of clarity on the specific content that leads to content limitation is the existence of an active, duplicitous, and sinister project aiming to slowly and silently squeeze adult content and its creators off of the platform. But it seems more likely that Twitter just doesn’t clarify everything that can lead to content limitation for fear that doing so would be a field guide for bad actors to use to game safeguards and harm users. \nWhat would a crackdown actually look like?\nEven if Twitter’s goals are all currently noble, Stabile argues this content limitation clause creates potential for future less honorable, more arbitrary and insidious suppression or bans. “Just having something on the books that allows people to censor or shut down things is concerning to us,” he explains. “People say, ‘It’s not going to be used this way,’ or, ‘It won’t affect you.’ What we’ve found historically, particularly with legislation but also at the corporate level, is that [blank checks like this] do get used. A new administration comes in. A press scandal arises. A financial incentive changes. And suddenly, well, you know.” Then adult content writ large is in the crosshairs. \n“These are the things we saw Tumblr do before going for the jugular” and fully banning adult content from its platform in December 2018, Stabile adds of the clarifications in Twitter’s current TOS. “The adult community in general is right to be nervous.” \nA few performers actually argue that a crackdown on adult content on Twitter could be a good thing for the industry. Sure, a sudden ban on all nude or sexual imagery might cause an initial shock, forcing every performer to spend weeks locking down and cleaning up their accounts, argues performer Jessy Dubai. Some may even lose accounts in the scrum and face the daunting task of rebuilding their follower bases from scratch. (A number of performers have told me that they’ve actually been preparing for this potential eventuality, creating secret SFW backup accounts that they'll switch over to as soon as their old accounts face new scrutiny or go dark.)\nYet, as Banks notes, performers often find that they develop a more loyal, considerate, and profitable fan base by posting only PG content on their Twitters — by using them purely for SFW interactions and personal brand building. DeVille notes that many stars can keep things clean enough to stay on Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat as well despite their crackdowns — and still get plenty of traffic from them. And the race to gain visibility and numbers on Twitter by posting the sort of explicit content that fans love, argues Dubai, just contributes to the industry’s free porn crisis. Cutting off the flow of explicit clips and pics on Twitter could, she suggests, force some people who depend on this sort of easily accessible promo material for their porn fixes to become paying customers and so help performers waste less time and earn more. \nHowever, implicit in these “it could be good for us” arguments is the idea that a crackdown on adult content would be transparent, fair, and consistent — three terms most performers would never apply to social media censorship enforcement. The feared risk of a crackdown is often less that Twitter will get rid of, say, pics of explicit penetration, and more that it will make haphazard, ill-informed, or secretly malicious and discriminatory judgements about when and how to apply vague, and as such potentially overbroad, new enforcement standards. (Twitter has long stressed that it allows anyone to appeal any actions it may take against their accounts or content. But this presumes that people know they have been targeted and so may not cover some forms of content limitation. Also, the availability of an appeals process does not always avoid harm or chilling effects for the targets. Just ask anyone subjected to an abusive SLAPP lawsuit in the United States.) \nRios argues that social media companies have historically been more permissive when applying their sex and nudity standards to pop stars, and more arbitrary or harsh when applying them to any sort of sex worker. Pelazzari and Stabile both argue that bias or ignorance on the part of users flagging and moderators reviewing content has always led nudity and sexuality censorship rules to have disproportionately severe — and often outright harmful — effects on sexual minorities. \nMajor porn stars believe they would be able to weather even a chaotic, severe, or even total war on adult content and workers on Twitter. They're able to shift their focus onto other social media accounts they are less worried about, or reach out to their well established fan bases via their web sites, cam chat rooms, or any other number of adult industry venues. And since Tumblr’s great porn apocalypse, a number of niche social media sites have attempted to bill themselves as fast growing, functional, and attractive mainstream alternatives with explicitly sex- and porn-positive outlooks. (Rios notes that AVN recently built its own monetizable social media platform, AVN Stars.) “Creating accounts on these alternative social media platforms will preserve a sense of survival for those feeling the Twitter pinch,” Jenson argues. “Every giant began as a novice.” \n“It’s not that things can’t be done elsewhere,” counters Stabile. “It’s just tremendously difficult.” Maintaining multiple accounts and fan bases across the internet is a time-consuming task, and may be infeasible for new, small, or marginalized creators who rely on Twitter as a potent central hub.   \nIn theory, some new and niche adult-friendly platforms could become hubs for adult performers, partially or fully replacing Twitter as an internal organizing and safety promotion tool at least. But none could fully replace Twitter, especially for brand and career building. As Rothfield notes, they don’t have the money or the manpower to expand. Most don’t even have an app. Even if they had the resources of a giant company like Pornhub (who seems to have no interest in this game), performer Karla Lane points out, most consumers wouldn’t want to have accounts on, much less publicly view, a site explicitly focused on or friendly to adult content. \nWhat people want is a one-site-fits-all platform, she argues, where they can view porn and engage with adult stars casually, with a veneer of deniability. A number of fans in countries that ban porn sites but allow Twitter, looking the other way on its porn content, would likely not be permitted to engage with these new platforms even if they did want to. Not even many art models, who might get booted from mainstream platforms in adult content clamp downs for nude photos, would want to be associated with a porn platform, argues adult star Sarah Russi. And to top it all off, Mel Magazine reports many new or niche platforms seem to have questionable TOS themselves. \nSo if the central, far-reaching, and socially acceptable hub of Twitter were to start seriously purging adult content or accounts from its platform — or to start seriously, if subtly, suppressing adult content or accounts — it would not cripple the adult industry. A few actors might not even feel a pinch. But it would be devastating to wide swathes of the adult world. \nRothfield is sure that small to mid-sized producers and performers would lose gobs of eyes and income. Stabile is sure that worker exploitation and endangerment would increase substantially. Performer and producer Lady Olivia Fyre is sure that it would seriously set back evolving public dialogue on sex work and sex workers’ rights. “I can’t overstate it,” stresses Stabile. “It really is a scary prospect.” \nThe ripple effects of a porn-pocalypse\nStabile also argues that if Twitter ever does seriously escalate restrictions on adult content, it should cause concern for more than just the porn world. “The adult industry is always the canary in the coal mines,” he argues. “We’re the ones they come after first. We’re a strawman for going after larger issues around sexuality, whether that’s LGBTQ, BDSM, or women’s issues. Because it is really not a huge jump from cracking down on porn to declaring a whole host of things obscene and pornographic. That’s the way that this has happened globally and historically.” \nIn the face of fears of this grim prospect, Twitter has always touted its commitment to free speech. And social media researcher Ysabel Gerrard points out that they certainly don’t seem to have any immediate interests or goals that would lead them to walk back that commitment in favor of limits on adult content or voices. “In Twitter’s summary of its latest transparency report,” she notes, the document in which it sets forth its key priorities, values, and concerns, “the company foregrounds issues like abuse, hate speech, and terrorism — the three biggest moderation-related criticisms currently leveled at the company. The summary page doesn’t even mention adult content.”  \nStill, this means the health and stability of the adult industry — and thus the safety and security of thousands of already marginalized workers — rides on Twitter continuing to honestly and diligently respect free speech for adult producers even though it has no legal obligation to do so and may face strong incentives to do otherwise in the future. Companies have demonstrated repeatedly that pressure from payment processors, investors, advertisers, or juicy potential markets can at times override respect for the speech and wellbeing of certain politically or financially unimportant groups, like porn stars.\nA number of reports also suggest that social media sites especially have been willing to step away from adult content — and certain types of wider sexual dialogue — entirely just to avoid the as of yet uncertain risk of legal trouble due to a poorly crafted and dangerous law passed in early 2018 by America’s Congress. (Known as FOSTA-SESTA, it holds online platforms liable for hosting user-created content that can be construed, broadly, as facilitating sex trafficking. Note that some anti-porn activists argue that all adult content does just that.) “It’s likely,” Pellazari, adds, “that the company would rather be criticized for restricting speech than for hosting a piece of content deemed violent or damaging” by powerful social or political actors or media figures. \n“All it takes,” argues Stabile, “is a new administration, or a political push, to make it happen… Everything is set up for this to happen. All that isn’t there now is the will to do it.” \nOnce that incentive arrives — that spark of censorship — “suddenly it all falls like dominoes.” \nPerformers Crystal Rush, Kimberly Chi, and Roxie Rae, and Suzanne Kelder of PervCity.com also shared their thoughts and insights for consideration in the research for this piece."},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1448298%252F1a28e409-59b2-48a7-a40b-b7613c4ab900.png%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.png?signature=DvJvBzE0BJkQn4w7r-V9eoIremI=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F117994%252Fe866fbdc-3f78-43da-aa42-0d3cbc738775.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=4wJ5YvkINWPqKaRR7jpS37viVu4=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F117994%252Fe866fbdc-3f78-43da-aa42-0d3cbc738775.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=Tk5MeGmftsoMx-s0CgTweCuIOTM=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F117994%252Fe866fbdc-3f78-43da-aa42-0d3cbc738775.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=baH7bSZ5zHlk7SK_k6kuHlHyanY=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F117994%252Fe866fbdc-3f78-43da-aa42-0d3cbc738775.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=Xp-Aktsru7PqdPi1wRfu2_WhbI0=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F117994%252Fe866fbdc-3f78-43da-aa42-0d3cbc738775.jpg%252F560x314.jpg?signature=PL-hg-ylNKXPZCDl8HeBo3hRjrk=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"Twitter and the porn apocalypse that could reshape the industry as we know it","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F117994%252Fe866fbdc-3f78-43da-aa42-0d3cbc738775.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=Tk5MeGmftsoMx-s0CgTweCuIOTM=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"jpg","loading":"lazy","version_webp_srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F117994%252Fe866fbdc-3f78-43da-aa42-0d3cbc738775.webp%252F280x157.webp?signature=ltU1gAfPPMqHTxchdDkRaYepl04=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F117994%252Fe866fbdc-3f78-43da-aa42-0d3cbc738775.webp%252F356x205.webp?signature=k5do-K3f3Iiw-5LPSY8NWLfOiIo=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F117994%252Fe866fbdc-3f78-43da-aa42-0d3cbc738775.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=Xp-Aktsru7PqdPi1wRfu2_WhbI0=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F117994%252Fe866fbdc-3f78-43da-aa42-0d3cbc738775.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=Tk5MeGmftsoMx-s0CgTweCuIOTM=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":{}},"display_title":"Twitter and the porn apocalypse that could reshape the industry as we know it","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"A crackdown on adult content has been feared for years, but will it ever happen?","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Culture","channel_label":"Culture","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Culture/","order_number":"","tweet_text":"Twitter and the porn apocalypse that could reshape the industry as we know it"},{"_id":"5f2dd33df171d20053000007","id":"/article/facebook-removes-qanon-group/","title":"Facebook just banned one of its biggest QAnon groups","title_tag":null,"author":"Matt Binder","post_date":"2020-08-07T22:18:35+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Fri, 07 Aug 2020 22:18:35 +0000","formatted_date":"08/07/2020","sort_key":"1K4kLC","link":"https://mashable.com/article/facebook-removes-qanon-group/","content":{"plain":"Hundreds of thousands of advocates of the QAnon conspiracy theory are going to have to find a new online hangout.\nThe second largest QAnon group on Facebook has been banned from the platform, the social network announced Thursday. The group, called “Official Q/Qanon,” had nearly 200,000 members at the time of its removal. Facebook said it took the page down on Tuesday.\nA Facebook spokesperson told Reuters that the group was banned over posts that repeatedly broke the platform’s rules on misinformation, harassment, and hate speech.\nBBC journalist Shayan Sardarizadeh points out that the “Official Q/Qanon” group received more than 10 million engagements across 500,000 posts during the first 7 months of 2020. The group spiked in membership in early March, just as the full-force of the coronavirus pandemic began to hit the United States.\nLook at how page likes went up after Covid hit. There's only one other QAnon Facebook group with more likes (215,000) and that one's still up. I just quickly had a look at the other BIG QAnon groups/pages and they're all still there; at least for now! Analysis via @crowdtangle pic.twitter.com/FnnQQXijtJ— Shayan Sardarizadeh (@Shayan86) August 7, 2020\n\nThe former members of that group won’t have to look far for a new online home for their conspiracy theories, however. There are still plenty of Facebook groups dedicated to QAnon on the platform, including one even bigger than the banned group, with more than 215,000 members. In its latest action, Facebook did not address other QAnon groups or content on its platform.\nIn May, Facebook removed a network of QAnon pages, groups, and profiles for coordinated inauthentic behavior, its term for users who create multiple fake accounts to game its engagement algorithm. The removals marked the first time the social media company took action against accounts related to the conspiracy theory. \nOther social media platforms have taken even more serious approaches when it comes to QAnon. \nJust two weeks ago, Twitter announced that it would block QAnon-related links from its platform. The company also said it would block QAnon content from its trends and recommendations sections. Shortly after Twitter’s announcement, TikTok also blocked QAnon-related terms and content from its search engine. In 2018, Reddit banned a number of QAnon subreddits, including its biggest.\nCelebrities such as Chrissy Tiegen have complained of coordinated mass online harassment from QAnon believers.\nQAnon is a far-right-wing conspiracy theory. Its followers believe that Donald Trump is secretly working to take down a global child-trafficking ring run by satanic pedophiles in Hollywood and the Democratic Party. Various other conspiracy theories have been rolled into QAnon, such as fringe elements from the anti-vaccine communities.\nThe conspiracy began in 2017 when an anonymous internet user going by the name “Q” began posting on 4Chan about a secret plot by the supposed “deep state” to take down President Trump. Conspiracy theorists believe that Q is an individual close to Trump and the conspiracy has continued to grow regardless of the fact that all of Q’s predictions have been

Specifically, up to $12. \nPast users of the now-defunct social media platform were hipped to a potential windfall Tuesday morning by an ominous looking email that helpfully assured wary recipients: \"You are not being sued.\" At issue is at least one \"bug\" which revealed non-public user data to third-party developers, and a resulting class-action lawsuit. \nAccording to the litigation website, you may qualify for a piece of the $7.5 million settlement if you are in the U.S., had a consumer Google+ account between January 1, 2015 and April 2, 2019, and had your \"non-public Profile Information exposed as a result of the software bugs Google announced on October 8, 2018 and December 10, 2018.\"\nYou have until Oct. 8, 2020, to file, and can do so here. \nNow, as is often the case with these things (remember Equifax?), there are a few important caveats. For starters, whether or not you get 12 whole dollars depends on how many people file a claim. As the the settlement info page explains, $12 is the maximum amount you may receive. You might just get pennies.\nSEE ALSO: Google to kill Google+ early after exposing personal data of more than 50 million\nAlso, the settlement needs to get final approval by the courts. That decision will be made on Nov. 19, but as it has already been granted preliminary approval, it should (theoretically) be approved with little fuss. \nSo fill out your claim, maybe get your $12, and then happily forget you ever willingly handed over your personal data to Google+ in the first place. "},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F117731%252Fd370b298-3afe-492d-a62e-08c0c43b55b1.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=6gyu7fXQMS4zhY1_yYGZ2K-ZoqY=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F117731%252Fd370b298-3afe-492d-a62e-08c0c43b55b1.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=RYCtlWWwmmYBPTW36pD0X_kcMk8=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F117731%252Fd370b298-3afe-492d-a62e-08c0c43b55b1.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=NYa8X39mbF04CmsG3ujAPeXZ-DQ=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F117731%252Fd370b298-3afe-492d-a62e-08c0c43b55b1.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=XXzykT_Z_ogg-9agiUiftGv57SA=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F117731%252Fd370b298-3afe-492d-a62e-08c0c43b55b1.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=Gl-RCpb3AFtsvXO0PE5DPqj9W2M=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F117731%252Fd370b298-3afe-492d-a62e-08c0c43b55b1.jpg%252F560x314.jpg?signature=S99WRhJV-PN9DeKKXfQEFGQQgZw=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"Google+ finally good for something: Getting you $12 (maybe)","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F117731%252Fd370b298-3afe-492d-a62e-08c0c43b55b1.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=NYa8X39mbF04CmsG3ujAPeXZ-DQ=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"jpg","loading":"lazy","version_webp_srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F117731%252Fd370b298-3afe-492d-a62e-08c0c43b55b1.webp%252F280x157.webp?signature=5GDF_4sBlEscOPWZAg7jeWVVv2Q=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F117731%252Fd370b298-3afe-492d-a62e-08c0c43b55b1.webp%252F356x205.webp?signature=QXRH6Bqn09DrcN8sLm7CykolEZ0=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F117731%252Fd370b298-3afe-492d-a62e-08c0c43b55b1.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=Gl-RCpb3AFtsvXO0PE5DPqj9W2M=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F117731%252Fd370b298-3afe-492d-a62e-08c0c43b55b1.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=NYa8X39mbF04CmsG3ujAPeXZ-DQ=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":{}},"display_title":"Google+ finally good for something: Getting you $12 (maybe)","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"If Google+ exposed your personal data, you have until Oct. 8 to file a claim.

Former KKK leader David Duke, one of the United States’ most well-known white supremacists, was banned from Twitter late Thursday night.\nAt.Long.Last. pic.twitter.com/WPY2uOqoWj— Michael Dickson (@michaeldickson) July 31, 2020\n\nAccording to a Twitter spokesperson, Duke’s account “has been permanently suspended for repeated violations of the Twitter Rules on hateful conduct.” \n“This enforcement action is in line with our recently-updated guidance on harmful links,” Twitter explained.\nCritics have long questioned how David Duke was able to remain on Twitter for so long. Duke joined Twitter in 2009, and spread white supremacist messages even as other openly white supremacist users were banned.\nEarlier this month, Gizmodo reported that Twitter didn't ban David Duke before because he was no longer part of the KKK and had publicly “distanced himself from the organization.”\nTwitter has long banned violent content directed toward people based on race, religion or ethnicity. However, it appears Duke’s ban stems from a recent rule change.\nAs we continue to address harmful content, we’ve updated our link policy:1️⃣ Hateful conduct and violence are now link content categories that we may block2️⃣ Accounts dedicated to sharing these types of links may be suspendedThe full policy: https://t.co/G99F3M779b— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) July 28, 2020\n\nOn July 28, Twitter said it would consider suspending users who shared harmful links to content that promoted \"hateful conduct and violence.\" Previously, harmful links were defined as URLs that directed users to phishing websites, malware, or other malicious websites.  \nThe most recently saved archive of his account from July 30 showed that Duke had more than 53,000 followers before he was given the boot by Twitter.\nThis is the second time Duke has been banned from a major online media platform this month. The former KKK leader’s YouTube channel was shut down by the company on June 30. \nDuke served as the grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan in the 1970s. He was elected to the Louisiana House of Representatives in 1989 where he served one term. He ran for U.S. Congress multiple times, most recently in 2016. Duke endorsed Donald Trump in 2016 and again in 2020."},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1428692%252Ff0ef479d-aa48-41ab-aab3-9742a2b5307b.png%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.png?signature=Lq-TUEiQzeJTme-yHFPZUjoU7fA=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F117623%252F9ccfba59-3d22-4d11-a132-7e8d486bc617.png%252F1438x0.png?signature=n3WLpmYlmjltJouEzOBDaFpzCu0=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F117623%252F9ccfba59-3d22-4d11-a132-7e8d486bc617.png%252F356x205.png?signature=glbmNGG4ncarBkLHoosmQP0vIBQ=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F117623%252F9ccfba59-3d22-4d11-a132-7e8d486bc617.png%252F712x410.png?signature=ioCQWHGzPZm6vubtEUOyYq5k650=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F117623%252F9ccfba59-3d22-4d11-a132-7e8d486bc617.png%252F280x157.png?signature=oLxrq4wdeEX49mORcPTCa91lPJI=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F117623%252F9ccfba59-3d22-4d11-a132-7e8d486bc617.png%252F560x314.png?signature=ag7Of1ItnVPIuP7L25kgJ9p7Toc=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"Twitter finally bans white supremacist David Duke","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F117623%252F9ccfba59-3d22-4d11-a132-7e8d486bc617.png%252F356x205.png?signature=glbmNGG4ncarBkLHoosmQP0vIBQ=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"png","loading":"lazy","version_webp_srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F117623%252F9ccfba59-3d22-4d11-a132-7e8d486bc617.webp%252F280x157.webp?signature=cB2p-C6ambK0VvI4hr9jihK7PW8=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F117623%252F9ccfba59-3d22-4d11-a132-7e8d486bc617.webp%252F356x205.webp?signature=xBaV_aGEUf1Nm0u-GkdPrcBM0uM=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F117623%252F9ccfba59-3d22-4d11-a132-7e8d486bc617.png%252F280x157.png?signature=oLxrq4wdeEX49mORcPTCa91lPJI=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F117623%252F9ccfba59-3d22-4d11-a132-7e8d486bc617.png%252F356x205.png?signature=glbmNGG4ncarBkLHoosmQP0vIBQ=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":{}},"display_title":"Twitter finally bans white supremacist David Duke","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"8P0BJzWX01","data-source":"blueprint"}],"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"The former grand wizard of the KKK signed up for Twitter in 2009.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Tech/","tweet_text":"Twitter finally bans white supremacist David Duke"},{"_id":"5f05ebb15444d00053000085","id":"/article/twitter-subscription-platform-paying-for-tweets/","title":"Twitter is building a 'subscription platform,' and paying for tweets might be a thing","title_tag":null,"author":"Jack Morse","post_date":"2020-07-08T15:52:12+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Wed, 08 Jul 2020 15:52:12 +0000","formatted_date":"07/08/2020","sort_key":"1JTeRi","link":"https://mashable.com/article/twitter-subscription-platform-paying-for-tweets/","content":{"plain":"\"This site is free\" is a common refrain on Twitter. Meant to be read in the tone of sarcastic disbelief, it's often brought out to highlight the absurdity of a situation that someone has, typically, stumbled ass-first into online — on full display for all Twitter users to witness in real time, free of charge. \nHowever, if a job listing on Twitter's job board is any indication, that last part might be going the way of 140-character limits. According to the posting for a senior full-stack software engineer, first listed \"10 days ago,\" the social media company is building a possibly paid subscription service. \nWhat does this mean, exactly? We reached out to multiple people at Twitter with a host of questions, but a spokesperson merely replied the company has \"nothing to share at the moment.\" We can guess, however, and that guess involves some form of paid — and possibly exclusive — subscription access to tweets. \n\"We are building a subscription platform, one that can be reused by other teams in the future,\" reads the job listing. \"This is a first for Twitter! [The new team] Gryphon is a team of web engineers who are closely collaborating with the Payments team and the Twitter.com team.\"\nThe job posting itself doesn't provide a lot of clarity as to Twitter's eventual plans, but it makes clear that the team behind the subscription platform will work closely with the internal Payments team. That does suggest some possible directions Twitter might head. \nImagine a future where celebrities and influencers can charge for access to their tweets. Or, news outlets can share breaking stories or in-depth reporting with their subscribers before their non-paying Twitter followers. In many ways, this is something that people already do via Patreon.\nIt's no shock that Twitter wants in on that game — even if it means the site, in all its wonderful and stupid glory, ceases to be 100 percent free.  \nUPDATE: July 8, 2020, 11:12 a.m. CDT: The story has been updated to include comment from a Twitter spokesperson."},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1388841%252Fb97ffc51-4822-41b2-9ef0-09380056fcd5.png%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.png?signature=ASvNe1trwr-NqP1VxfkfNVK4b34=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F116736%252F155ea656-481b-46cb-9002-c55e528416d4.png%252F1438x0.png?signature=sKYFmVeMrH-X8e7vLj4sqYXHF_c=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F116736%252F155ea656-481b-46cb-9002-c55e528416d4.png%252F356x205.png?signature=3Iw8_wkWg7X11asJ5SCYRRk8W1I=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F116736%252F155ea656-481b-46cb-9002-c55e528416d4.png%252F712x410.png?signature=6RuHAWLuT8EegJ02i-sm4v7-TcY=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F116736%252F155ea656-481b-46cb-9002-c55e528416d4.png%252F280x157.png?signature=pr82ftBhcFwsrkgFhY5HPrwq4yM=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F116736%252F155ea656-481b-46cb-9002-c55e528416d4.png%252F560x314.png?signature=-CY9de-CDkpGTnm0R3rB2yx4fw8=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"Twitter is building a 'subscription platform,' and paying for tweets might be a thing","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F116736%252F155ea656-481b-46cb-9002-c55e528416d4.png%252F356x205.png?signature=3Iw8_wkWg7X11asJ5SCYRRk8W1I=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"png","loading":"lazy","version_webp_srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F116736%252F155ea656-481b-46cb-9002-c55e528416d4.webp%252F280x157.webp?signature=nBJ5wWNmrZF9yXKx-19MDGh7r_I=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F116736%252F155ea656-481b-46cb-9002-c55e528416d4.webp%252F356x205.webp?signature=l-qsZcaTDv6OUDbkZj7cPczTbWQ=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F116736%252F155ea656-481b-46cb-9002-c55e528416d4.png%252F280x157.png?signature=pr82ftBhcFwsrkgFhY5HPrwq4yM=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F116736%252F155ea656-481b-46cb-9002-c55e528416d4.png%252F356x205.png?signature=3Iw8_wkWg7X11asJ5SCYRRk8W1I=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":{}},"display_title":"Twitter is building a 'subscription platform,' and paying for tweets might be a thing","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"A Twitter job listing reveals the company's plans.

The feature, which Instagram started testing back in May, is officially now available everywhere.\nInstagram's VP of Product, Vishal Shah, took to Twitter to announce that you can now pin a few (of what will likely be your favorite) comments to the top of the comments thread on your posts.\nToday we’re rolling out pinned comments everywhere 📌That means you can a pin a few comments to the top of your feed post. By highlighting positive comments, you can better manage the tone of the conversation. ❤️ pic.twitter.com/w2X5grdee7— Vishal Shah (@vishalshahis) July 7, 2020\n\nThis is just one of a few new features Instagram announced a few months back to help limit the harassment and bullying that goes on within the social media app. Other features include the ability to delete comments in bulk and choose who can tag and mention you on specific posts.\nTo access the Pinned Comments feature, you'll have to first make sure you've updated your Instagram app to the latest version. Then, tap on any of your Instagram posts and head to the comments section. Once you've found a specific comment you want to pin, swipe to the left and tap on the thumbtack icon.\nYou can pin up to three comments to the top of your post at a time, all of which will appear right underneath your photo with a \"Pinned\" label underneath it. If you try to pin more than three, you'll receive a notification reminding you of the limit.\nBut you can easily swap out pinned comments for new ones. To unpin a comment, simply swipe to the left and tap on the thumbtack icon again. \n\nBut it's important to note each user receives a notification if their comment is pinned. So, you might want to really think about whose compliments you're choosing to place front and center.\nRegardless, perhaps the ability to pin comments might encourage more people on Instagram to want to post nice ones in the hopes that theirs will get pinned to the top — a very tall order, I know, but a girl can dream."},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1387440%252F6df92aed-b30f-4d68-bfae-e92fefe7c4a3.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=k9dYuDnmE20eML6ngfNCSYaKDFE=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F116698%252F35c942a1-fcec-4ef6-840a-9599fb5ff67e.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=kriv6kzsFpZ04NfWUBs3hSEsJio=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F116698%252F35c942a1-fcec-4ef6-840a-9599fb5ff67e.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=o0wo173DTX-UIfEYy9iuFqIn6nA=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F116698%252F35c942a1-fcec-4ef6-840a-9599fb5ff67e.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=qyQYvO7fnI6Y3jRSE77GjzdmDEU=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution:

specifically telling users it wouldn't. \nIn a Wednesday blog post, Facebook announced that (oops!) thousands of developers continued to receive updates to users' non-public information well past the point when they should have. Specifically, Facebook said that, for an unspecified number of users, it failed to cut off the data spigot — like it promised it would back in 2018 — 90 days after a person had last used an app. \nWe reached out to Facebook in an attempt to determine just how many users had their data improperly sent to third-party apps, but received no immediate response. \nFacebook's blog post does provide some — albeit limited — insight into the privacy mishap, however. The company writes that the user info in question possibly involved email addresses, birthdays, language, and gender, and was sent to around 5,000 apps past the 90-day threshold. \n\"[Recently], we discovered that in some instances apps continued to receive the data that people had previously authorized, even if it appeared they hadn’t used the app in the last 90 days,\" writes Konstantinos Papamiltiadis, Facebook's vice president of platform partnerships, in the blog post. \"For example, this could happen if someone used a fitness app to invite their friends from their  hometown to a workout, but we didn’t recognize that some of their friends had been inactive for many months.\"\nWe also asked Facebook how \"recently\" it discovered the error, but received no immediate response. \nNotably, this is not the first time third-party developers have been given improper access to Facebook users' data. In late 2019, Papamiltiadis wrote yet another blog post laying out the shockingly familiar situation. \n\"[We] recently found that some apps retained access to group member information, like names and profile pictures in connection with group activity, from the Groups API, for longer than we intended,\" wrote Papamiltiadis at the time. \"We know at least 11 partners accessed group members' information in the last 60 days.\"\nOh yeah, and in 2018 Papamiltiadis was forced to awkwardly explain why certain third-party companies were given troubling amounts of access to Facebook users' data. He assured everyone then, as he assured everyone today, that the company was working on it. \nSEE ALSO: Here are the (many) companies pulling their ads from Facebook\n\"We’ve taken a number of steps this year to limit developers' access to people's Facebook information, and as part of that ongoing effort, we're in the midst of reviewing all our APIs and the partners who can access them,\" he wrote. \nSigh. No wonder this all sounded so familiar. "},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F116560%252F7f2a4220-94af-4dff-93a6-e895c86768d5.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=_9OsDjpmA3iWLML_c7Y1VyzMUR4=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F116560%252F7f2a4220-94af-4dff-93a6-e895c86768d5.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=7y1TlrGNjBfcXRDHQTPJnq1V8gI=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F116560%252F7f2a4220-94af-4dff-93a6-e895c86768d5.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=BxJVFIoS4N6GCkWBYyKTaSIP9Ws=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F116560%252F7f2a4220-94af-4dff-93a6-e895c86768d5.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=AYoKlQbuBfsNG8OnCQ8foegQ2sk=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F116560%252F7f2a4220-94af-4dff-93a6-e895c86768d5.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=KnEGg5OVQTnEiN6wNyFM2qhNv34=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F116560%252F7f2a4220-94af-4dff-93a6-e895c86768d5.jpg%252F560x314.jpg?signature=BMaNapu_f49blEZ_kf6EVemEz8o=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"Facebook admits to improperly giving user data to third-party developers, again","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F116560%252F7f2a4220-94af-4dff-93a6-e895c86768d5.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=BxJVFIoS4N6GCkWBYyKTaSIP9Ws=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"jpg","loading":"lazy","version_webp_srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F116560%252F7f2a4220-94af-4dff-93a6-e895c86768d5.webp%252F280x157.webp?signature=BC2g9lDH_sGVezfpM7Ei8w3bSMQ=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F116560%252F7f2a4220-94af-4dff-93a6-e895c86768d5.webp%252F356x205.webp?signature=ogC5gnLI7GeUQf7WIjY4lAs4-1s=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F116560%252F7f2a4220-94af-4dff-93a6-e895c86768d5.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=KnEGg5OVQTnEiN6wNyFM2qhNv34=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F116560%252F7f2a4220-94af-4dff-93a6-e895c86768d5.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=BxJVFIoS4N6GCkWBYyKTaSIP9Ws=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":{}},"display_title":"Facebook admits to improperly giving user data to third-party developers, again","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"No, you're not having déjà vu.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Tech/","tweet_text":"Facebook admits to improperly giving user data to third-party developers, again"},{"_id":"5efbbe587a9fc20065000002","id":"/article/facebook-boogaloo-movement-ban/","title":"Facebook bans far right ‘Boogaloo’ accounts from its platform","title_tag":null,"author":"Matt Binder","post_date":"2020-06-30T22:36:02+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Tue, 30 Jun 2020 22:36:02 +0000","formatted_date":"06/30/2020","sort_key":"1JQwdO","link":"https://mashable.com/article/facebook-boogaloo-movement-ban/","content":{"plain":"Facebook is cracking down on the Boogaloo movement.\nOn Tuesday, the social media giant announced that it was classifying a network on its platform associated with the boogaloo movement as a “dangerous organization.” As a result, this network has been banned from the platform. \nThe Boogaloo boys, as members are often referred, are a far right libertarian extremist movement seeking to incite a civil war in the U.S. \nIn a statement, Facebook said that it removed 220 Facebook accounts, 106 Facebook Groups, 28 Facebook Pages, and 95 Instagram accounts associated with the Boogaloo movement. The social network also removed 400 additional groups and 100 more pages that it said hosted content similar to that of the banned Boogaloo accounts.\n“Today we are designating a violent US-based anti-government network as a dangerous organization and banning it from our platform,” said Facebook in a statement. “This network uses the term boogaloo but is distinct from the broader and loosely-affiliated boogaloo movement because it actively seeks to commit violence. For months, we have removed boogaloo content when there is a clear connection to violence or a credible threat to public safety, and today’s designation will mean we remove more content going forward, including Facebook Groups and Pages.”\nThe Boogaloo movement rose to national prominence during the coronavirus pandemic lockdown protests. Boogaloo boys also appeared at Black Lives Matter protests in the wake of the police killing of George Floyd late last month. Members of the movement are often identifiable by their trademark Hawaiian shirts and are usually carrying firearms.\nSteven Carrillo, who identifies as a member of the Boogaloo movement, was arrested last month for allegedly killing a federal officer during a protest in Oakland, California. According to Carrillo, he planned the attack with a man whom he met in a Boogaloo Facebook Group. Carillo is also accused of killing a Santa Cruz sheriff's deputy. \nJust earlier this month, three men who also identified as members of the Boogaloo movement were arrested and hit with federal charges for attempting to incite violence at the protests.\nAdvocacy groups warned Facebook in April that the Boogaloo movement was organizing on its platform. In response, the social media company prohibited the use of certain Boogaloo-related terminology when accompanied with calls for violence or violent imagery. Not long after that, Facebook also said it would no longer recommend groups that were associated with the movement in an effort to limit its spread.\nFacebook is currently facing a major advertiser boycott due to inaction when it comes to hate speech, violence, and misinformation on its platform."},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1376456%252Feb16c7a9-2385-46dd-81b0-0f88db2f52a7.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=Gg9TSs43vkbJEBLjwvhPGrl21Kc=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F116508%252F718b8b1b-e22f-4941-a53c-a7225d529413.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=RqgKTAKcAXxedsNi0MuwSq4Ab2g=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F116508%252F718b8b1b-e22f-4941-a53c-a7225d529413.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=LW3p-9wegSjqyR9Y4JDah46EALg=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F116508%252F718b8b1b-e22f-4941-a53c-a7225d529413.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=6mCdWJ5flEmaCXA_JEdGsTfYnSo=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F116508%252F718b8b1b-e22f-4941-a53c-a7225d529413.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=t4H50jDB7ojgkh3G6rSLRUoeiyg=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F116508%252F718b8b1b-e22f-4941-a53c-a7225d529413.jpg%252F560x314.jpg?signature=JJhTUWr0G-Au5ECD-swZRzuzc58=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"Facebook bans far right ‘Boogaloo’ accounts from its platform","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F116508%252F718b8b1b-e22f-4941-a53c-a7225d529413.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=LW3p-9wegSjqyR9Y4JDah46EALg=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"jpg","loading":"lazy","version_webp_srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F116508%252F718b8b1b-e22f-4941-a53c-a7225d529413.webp%252F280x157.webp?signature=_N6hoSXWH42p3CIzC7dxNZk0VOs=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F116508%252F718b8b1b-e22f-4941-a53c-a7225d529413.webp%252F356x205.webp?signature=GKLorJAvpMnrSoZeyu5weokgeqc=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F116508%252F718b8b1b-e22f-4941-a53c-a7225d529413.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=t4H50jDB7ojgkh3G6rSLRUoeiyg=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F116508%252F718b8b1b-e22f-4941-a53c-a7225d529413.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=LW3p-9wegSjqyR9Y4JDah46EALg=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":{}},"display_title":"Facebook bans far right ‘Boogaloo’ accounts from its platform","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"Hundreds of accounts were removed.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Tech/","tweet_text":"Facebook bans far right ‘Boogaloo’ accounts from its platform"}]
